            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>'TIS an uneaſie Reflection, but a very reaſonable Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, That no Perſon will view over this ſmall Collection of ſome few uneven Thoughts, with any Delight comparable to what I had in the compoſing of it; thoſe Satisfactions are, I well know, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, and in their nature not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrable, or elſe I would heartily remit them to every Reader; the
<pb facs="tcp:59586:3"/>Meditations herein contained did, I confeſs, much affect and delight me while they were upon the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, though perhaps herein I ſhall prove to reſemble a mean active Preacher, that warms only his own Affections and ſtarves thoſe of his Auditors; I have this to ſolace my ſelf withal, [let the Effect other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be never ſo ſmall] That I ſought out theſe things for no other reaſon, but becauſe I my ſelf had pleaſure therein, and originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned an intire confinement of them to my own private ſatisfaction; poſſibly, by their publication, I ſhall be told, I have miſtaken my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and medled with things that are too great and too high for an ordinary Genius, and have brought my ſelf under the correction of that old Axiom, <hi>Preſtat de</hi> Carthagine <hi>Tacere quam pauca dicere;</hi> 'Tis better
<pb facs="tcp:59586:3"/>to ſay nothing of <hi>Carthage,</hi> than to ſay but a little. I will not contend with this Reproof, nor yet labour after any farther Excuſe than what I find made for me in that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd modern Expreſſion, <hi>In mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis voluiſſe ſat est.</hi> The Matters here treated of, are I well know of a ſublime Nature, and require the deepeſt Conſideration and Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore I have all along propoſed to my ſelf what I am ſure is the ſafeſt Method; which is, to walk by the Light of Revelation, and take the Scriptures in all that I have ſaid for my only Guide; if Men will underſtand any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of God's Eternal Councels and Deſigns, touching the Making, Ruling, and Saving, of the World, here they muſt have it; 'tis to no purpoſe to hearken to any other Inſtructor, but the Holy Ghoſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="tcp:59586:4"/>theſe Matters, for none knows the Mind of God herein, but the Spirit of God alone; the Wiſdom and Philoſophy of the World has, after its utmoſt Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Purſuits after theſe things, attained no farther, but to record their own inſufficiency and folly; the Holy Scriptures, as they are the great Luminary placed by God in this lower Firmament, to inform and enlighten the rational part of the World in all Sacred Things, ſo they are the Rule and the Standard by which all Divine and Religious Concerns are to be tryed and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: 'Tis a ſorry change, and a very mean ſhift, to forſake the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Determinations of God that he has tranſmitted unto us upon Record; and by an Appeal from them, to put Religion upon tryal by the failing uncertain Opinions and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
<pb facs="tcp:59586:4"/>of Men: It ought to be made a perpetual <hi>Memorandum</hi> in the Church, in order to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Direction, that when our bleſſed Saviour came, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Points that ever were debated on Earth were then on foot, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were the True <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or No? And whether the Religion eſtabliſhed by him was to diſſolve and diſcharge the Moſaical oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and of right to ſucceed it? Our Saviour and the Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not upon any one Proof, but what they fetch'd from the Old Teſtament; not a word of the Church then, nor any of thoſe Humane Authorities, the preſſing of which upon the Minds of Men has ſo peſter'd and diſordered the World ever ſince, and whenever they conteſted either with the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or with Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb facs="tcp:59586:5"/>they never uſed other Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon than the Scriptures, nor was any other <hi>Medium</hi> ſo much as once mentioned by them to determinate Divine Things by, although that Age was as much filled with the Noiſe of Tradition and the Church as any that hath been ſince. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he is treating of the deepeſt Points, flies to that Interrogatory Appeal, <hi>But what ſaith the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture?</hi> And I doubt not but the glorious State of the Church in the laſt times, ſo much fore-ſpoke of, will conſiſt in a ſtrict and cloſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with the Canon of the Scriptures, and appearing in the Splendor of an Entire Conformity to the Laws of Chriſt, utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting all Humane Authorities, and all ſuch Conſtitutions of which Chriſt himſelf is not the Author, and ſuch as by which the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
<pb facs="tcp:59586:5"/>Fabrick has been chiefly erected. 'Tis of great remark, That the laſt <hi>Item</hi> God gave to the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when the Spirit of Propheſie ceaſed, and with which the Old Teſtament is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, was to prevent an invaſion of Humane Traditions, and to oblige them to an exact Conformity and Obedience to what he himſelf had preſcribed them, <hi>Remember the Law of Moſes, my Servant, which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded unto him in Horeb for all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, with the Statutes and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And our Saviour's laſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to his Diſciples, when he left the World, was, That they ſhould teach all Nations <hi>to obſerve whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had commanded them;</hi> to prevent all other Legiſlators from uſurping Authority in the Church.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59586:6"/>
            <p>In the following Diſcourſe, I have alſo applied my ſelf (as much as the Matter would give me leave) to the uſe of Scripture-Phraſes, as thinking to all Inquirers into theſe Matters, thoſe would prove the moſt acceptable Words, and alſo, becauſe the Scripture is beſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by it ſelf; Scripture-Notions ſound beſt and are moſt properly utter'd in Scripture-Expreſſions, and what in one place looks obſcure, is often ſo expreſſed in another, as renders it obviouſly intelligible and eaſie; we can never be too much inur'd to Scripture-Expreſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scriptures contain in them, after an admirable manner, a Sacred Language, and Holy Dialect, dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God himſelf, for him and his People to converſe together in; here it is that holy Men have of old, and all good Men, to the end of the
<pb facs="tcp:59586:6"/>World, will conſtantly learn, in what Language to expreſs their Prayers and their Praiſes, and how to utter themſelves in all their Approaches to the Moſt High, and in whatſoever converſe they ſhall happen to have with him; 'tis the Treaſury of all Divine Utterance and Expreſſion, both from God to Man, and from Man to God, and which the Holy Ghoſt will principally make uſe of in all the intercourſe that will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the Church to the end of the World, and will very particularly make ſuch skilful in, who are to bring down the Lively Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and to adminiſter in Sacred Things; every Man comes naturally to ſpeak and underſtand this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Language, when he is born of the Spirit, and brought up in the Nurture and Inſtruction of the Holy Ghoſt. The prophane part of the World are
<pb facs="tcp:59586:7"/>ever deriding this, and making it a conſtant part of their diverſion: Now what a profound ſolid part of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion do ſuch Men act, who have in contempt the Reſult and Effects of Infinite Wiſdom? The <hi>Papiſts</hi> have a Saying, <hi>That never any Dog barked at a Crucifix, but he run mad.</hi> The Moral of that Fable is very good, and may ſerve to inſtruct a <hi>prophane Proteſtant;</hi> God himſelf gives a very ſolemn, and withal, dreadful Caution and Premonition to all prophane Scoffers, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſaias, Be not Mockers,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>lest your Bands be made ſtrong;</hi> that is, leſt I chuſe your Deluſion, and give you irrecoverably up to your own prophane ſence, which will be found at laſt to be the worſt ſort of Madneſs.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59586:7"/>
            <p>I will not believe any will be ſo unneceſſary critical and nice, as to blame the Title of this ſmall Tract, in regard the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel is ſo very often in Scripture denominated by <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> called <hi>the Mountain of the Lord's Houſe, which is to be ſet up upon the top of the Mountains:</hi> And to this <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> that is, to the Goſpel-Catholick Church, are ſome way or other related all the bleſſed and glorious Spirits that are extant, the fallen Angels are only excluded; for by coming to this Mount, the Apoſtle tells us, we are come <hi>to God the Judge of all, to Jeſus the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the New Covenant, to an innumerable company of Angels, and to the Spirits of Just Men made perfect.</hi> A great part of a true Chriſtian's Life, and I am ſure the beſt part of it, is a Converſe with
<pb facs="tcp:59586:8"/>Spirits; the beſt and nobleſt part of Man is a Spirit, and he muſt ſhortly for ſome time exiſt only in that part, and when the Body is reunited to it, that ſecond Coalition and Conſtitution will be altogether Spiritual, for a Soul and a Spiritual Body conjoyned, will render a Man not leſs Spiritual than he was while he exiſted ſingly in his Soul, but will make him perfectly like to an Angel; ſo we are told by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, That <hi>in the Reſurrection the Saints ſhall be like to the Angels of God.</hi> Upon this account God is training us up, and gradually fitting and preparing of us for this ſtate; he is acquainting us (as much as our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition will allow) with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and other Spirits here, that ſo we may joyfully reſign up our earthly ſtate, to become of their number, and at laſt abide in that
<pb facs="tcp:59586:8"/>condition that will be purely Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, without any ſort of Terrene Allay; and ſuch who live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Communion with Spirits here, and have no ſort of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte, nor any preparative reliſh of that ſtate, muſt needs (if they any way make uſe of the thinking faculty) leave their Bodies with very great Amuſements.</p>

            <p>THis Epiſtle is a Funeral Sermon preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Interment of the Law, the material Body of <hi>Moſes</hi> God himſelf buried long before, and no man ever knew the place of his Sepulture, and now his myſtical Body, his Doctrine, growing old and ready to vaniſh away, ripe for abolition, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſſolution, not ſo much by being repealed or reſcinded, but its uſe ceaſing, the end and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59586:10"/>of it appearing, and its glory being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and of courſe ſwallowed up and diſſolved into a greater glory that excels. The Holy Ghoſt himſelf by this Epiſtle lays it honourably in the grave, and ſo we have the Sepulchre of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body of <hi>Moſes</hi> abiding with us at this day: And happy had it been for the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> if this Sermon had had its due ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon them, God in his wiſe and gracious Providence, gave them this Warning, this Holy Inſtruction and Admonition, to prevent their obſtinate adhaeſion to the Moſaical Rites, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent oppoſition of the Goſpel thereby, which end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a very few years after the writing of this Epiſtle, in the ſad and utter Ruine of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their City and themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Penman of this Epiſtle, by ſuch Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities as come very near to a Certainty, appears to be St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that Perſon whom it pleaſed God ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to make uſe of in the glorious Fulfilling of that early prophetick Prediction; <hi>God ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Japheth to dwell in the tents of Sem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The exact Time when this Epiſtle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is very uncertain, Antiquity affords us little or no Information about it, what Knowledge we can have of it muſt be by conſulting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and comparing it with it ſelf: It ſeems rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote it after his Releaſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> from two Years Impriſonment there, with which the Story of the Acts of the Apoſtles ends, wherein is contained an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Hiſtory of the Church for about 28 Years after our Saviour's Reſurrection unto the 7th Year of <hi>Nere;</hi> that he wrote it after his Releaſe,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59586:10"/>appears from hence, that <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 23. he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends and promiſeth a Journey with <hi>Timothy,</hi> which had he been a Priſoner, and not in his own power, is not reaſonable to think he would have done: 'Tis likewiſe very probable to be written before the ſharpeſt and moſt violent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions fell upon the believing <hi>Jews;</hi> before the ſlaughter <hi>Herod</hi> made at the inſtance of the <hi>Jews</hi> of St. <hi>James</hi> and thoſe at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe he tells them in this Epiſtle, they had not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted unto Blood: and 'tis very evident to be writ, and to be well known to the <hi>Jews,</hi> before St. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote his ſecond Epiſtle, for therein he ſeems very plainly to refer to this Epiſtle; and if ſo, then 'tis plain alſo beyond denial the Author of it was St. <hi>Paul: And Account</hi> [ſays he] <hi>that the long ſuffering of our Lord is ſalvation, even as our beloved brother Paul alſo according to the wiſdom gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him hath written unto you.</hi> Now 'tis well known St. <hi>Paul</hi> writ no other Epiſtle to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but only this, and that St. <hi>Peter</hi> refers particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this, his next words ſeem to infer, <hi>As alſo in all his Epiſtles ſpeaking in them of theſe things:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, Do you <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe fatal day is coming, and near at hand, account Chriſt's long ſuffering to be ſalvation, according as <hi>Paul,</hi> by a Divine Wiſdom given to him, has written to you, in an Epiſtle of his, particularly directed to you, and has alſo in all his other Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> generally diſcourſed of this matter, in which there are <hi>ſome things hard to be underſtood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Epiſtle is directed to the Believing <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> who of all the Converts of the Apoſtles Miniſtry, and the firſt Age of the Church, were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59586:11"/>in the greateſt danger of relapſes, and needed the ſtrongeſt and moſt renewed ſupports, and that upon ſeveral accounts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Religion they left, was in its original of God's own inſtitution, and moſt ſtrongly founded upon the higheſt Divine Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and practiſed by their Fore-fathers for a ſucceſſion of many Ages and Generations, with ſingular Atteſtations of God's Preſence and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, above all the Nations of the Earth; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of which being ſtrenuouſly preſſed upon them, [as no doubt it was] by their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Circumciſion, might often occaſion them to look back, and meditate a retreat from the Chriſtian Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To be embodied with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Uncircumciſion, as by the Goſpel they were to be, and coaleſs with them into one Church ſtate, was a thing to which they were born and bred, and every way inur'd, to the greateſt antipathy and oppoſition.</p>
            <p>And, Thirdly, Becauſe the Perſecutions they met with, were generally more grievous and preſſing, and leſs tolerable, than what any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of that Age encounter'd withal, none em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Chriſtian Profeſſion upon greater peril than they, the whole Body of the <hi>Jews</hi> being enraged much more againſt ſuch, than againſt the <hi>Gentil</hi> Believers, and in what place ſoever they met with any of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Converts, their buſineſs was to heat the Furnace of Perſecution ſeven times hotter, as appears evidently where ever they went, in the caſe of all the Apoſtles, and particularly of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59586:11"/>
            <p>As no man beſides that Bleſſed Apoſtle, none of thoſe Divine Embaſſadors God at any time em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to treat with the World, were ever ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, as to be called up into the third Heavens, and receive their Inſtructions immediately from thence, ſo no man could have a greater Province upon his hand, nor a weightier Task to perform, as God himſelf told <hi>Ananias</hi> in the 9th of the <hi>Acts: He is a choſen veſſel unto me to bear my Name before the Gentils and kings and the children of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The Apoſtleſhip of the Uncircumciſion, and by the Miniſtry thereof, obliged to depoſe all the Gods of the Nations, and engage in their utter ſubverſion, and to clear the World from that Miſt of Darkneſs they had been ſo long hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink'd withal, and that Religious Rubbiſh they had ſo long lain under.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And which he found the more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Task, to bring the Circumciſion, his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren according to the fleſh, the <hi>Jews,</hi> to a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold aſſent; firſt, to behold Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom they had crucified as the true Meſſiah, to look unto this Jeſus as the Author and Finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all Salvation, that great and only Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice intended from the beginning, to make the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement between God and Man, and once to be offer'd up in the end of the World to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that according to all the Predictions of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, this Jeſus the Son of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> born at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> was exactly the Perſon that was by himſelf to compleat the Work of Man's Redemption, and that in perſuance of thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, by offering up himſelf to God upon the Croſs he actually had done it; which two things
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59586:12"/>by the way, made the difference between the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and that of Chriſt and the Apoſtles after the Reſurrection; the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was, to initiate men into this belief, that that ſame Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> whom he pointed them unto, [for he pointed to the very perſon, whom all the Prophets before had but at large foretold; and therefore our Saviour ſays he exceeded all the Prophets that went before him, and was more than a Prophet] and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Preaching and working of Miracles, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about doing Good, was the true Meſſiah fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told from the beginning, the very individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that was to redeem and ſave the World, and therefore in the 7th of <hi>Luke,</hi> v. 29. <hi>they that were baptized with his Baptiſm</hi> are ſaid <hi>to juſtifie God,</hi> by believing his Teſtimony concerning the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah. The Baptiſm of Chriſt and the Apoſtles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reſurrection, [for the Apoſtles baptized with <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm before] was to initiate men into this belief, that that ſame Jeſus that was to do it, actually had done it, by his Death, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Reſurrection, and ſo was enter'd into his mediatory Dominion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To bring the <hi>Jews</hi> to aſſent to this as a certain and undoubted verity, that <hi>Shiloh</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actually come, there would of neceſſity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a change of the whole ſtate of Religion, a new oeconomy would enſue, the times of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation being come, all things were to become new, and a Temporal Reign of the Meſſiah upon the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Policy [which they thought unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable] in the Land of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> was an abſolute Dream and Deluſion: And although this Apoſtle had in many other of his Epiſtles confuted ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59586:12"/>of their chief Doctrines, and battered down many of their chiefeſt and ſtrongeſt Forts, as they were made uſe of to ſtand in oppoſition to Chriſt, and fence out the Goſpel, as that touching Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Works, and thoſe concerning the true uſe of Circumciſion and all the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; yet in this he very particularly lays the Ax to the Root of the Tree, and the deſign of the whole Epiſtle is to ſuperſede the Law by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to place Chriſt in the room of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to make the Law ſpeak out plain its own natural and genuine uſe and deſignment, and that in the very nature of it; it was no longer to continue, then until the times of Reformation, being but <hi>a ſhadow of good things to come,</hi> but not the very image of the things themſelves: And in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, he accommodates himſelf chiefly to them of the Circumciſion, for thoſe he well knew would with the greateſt difficulty become Proſelites to this Doctrin, and the Methods by which he begins, and by which he proceeds throughout this Whole <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle</hi> in order to this matter, are of admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to the Church in all ſucceeding Ages.</p>
            <p>Upon two things the ſtreſs of his whole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe ſeems to be chiefly and principally laid, Firſt, In reſpect of the Perſon that publiſheth and delivers the Goſpel: And, Secondly, In reſpect of the Nature and ſuper-exceeding Excellency of the Doctrine publiſhed and delivered, the Goſpel in the very kind and conſtitution of it, utterly exceeding all the Diſpenſations of God that ever preceded it, being the very natural, genuine and proper Iſſue and Product of them, all Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations ſince the World began tended to Chriſt and the Goſpel as their ultimate End and Center.</p>

            <p>Although God had by ſundry Ways, and by divers Perſons, both Angels and Men, at ſeveral times, diſtinctly declared his Mind to the World, yet he never before ſpake by his Son, this is the Memorial of the Goſpel throughout all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that <hi>it was first publiſhed by the Lord, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confirmed by thoſe that heard him:</hi> it came firſt from the Oracle of his Sacred Mouth, and was ſanctified by his moſt Bleſſed Lips, and upon that account well may it be called, as it is, in the 1ſt of <hi>Timothy, The glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, that all former Divine Revelations brought to us either by the Miniſtry of Angels, or Men, were the Voice of God, and had him for their Author; but herein lyes the peculiarity of the Goſpel Glory above them all, that now he ſpeaks to us without any intermediate Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, perſonally Himſelf in his Son, he comes Himſelf from Heaven, Tabernacles in Humane Fleſh, becomes <hi>Emanuel,</hi> converſeth with us, and ſpeaks Face to Face with us in our own Nature: Let us with an Holy Aſtoniſhment [as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid in another caſe] turn aſide and view this great Sight, and cry out with the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> in Holy Admiration, <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou art mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of him, and the ſon of man, that thou ſhouldest ſo viſit him:</hi> and conſider deeply what infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention was this, that when nothing elſe would ſerve to recover the loſt World, God comes from Heaven himſelf, to treat with us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our recovery; ſo that no man can now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſay, who ſhall aſcend into Heaven to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us from thence, or who ſhall fetch Divine Knowledge beneath from the Deeps, for all that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59586:14"/>we need to know, and all that we can know, is brought home to our Dores, is put into our Hearts, and into our Mouths, by God himſelf in the faſhion of a Man, and like to us in all things, ſin only excepted.</p>
            <p>Two things the Apoſtle ſeems to inſinuate, in his very firſt entrance and the beginning of this Epiſtle: <hi>God who at ſundry times and divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſpake in time past unto the fathers, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, hath in theſe last days ſpoken to us by his Son:</hi> Firſt, That it was the ſame God that ſpake now, that ſpake before by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and ſo prevents their taking prejudice againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as if it came from any other hand than the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or were built upon any other Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation than <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets.</p>
            <p>And, Secondly, That God ſpeaking now by his Son, we may reaſonably expect to hear more than ever was yet known, and all that we are like ever to know by way of Revelation from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; ſuch a Perſon as He, may well be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bring down all God's Errand to the World at once, he has none greater to ſend by; and upon that account it is, that the Goſpel times are called in Scripture, <hi>the last times,</hi> becauſe no more Revelation is to be expected.</p>
            <p>If we conſider Chriſt as he is God, he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted far above all Heavens, and beyond all reach of Compariſons; if we conſider him in that conjunction as he was Man, even in that ſtate he is Heir of all things; he is the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of every creature, and in all things has the pre-eminence; he exceeds the nobleſt of creatures, the Angels, thoſe glorious Spirits, who in their very make and conſtitution were neareſt of kin
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59586:15"/>of all others to their Creator, and are called <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> a ſort of Gods; for God never ſaid unto any of them, <hi>thou art my Son, this day</hi> [ſpeaking both of Chriſt's Incarnation and Reſurrection] <hi>have I begotten thee:</hi> but at the Son's firſt arrival in the World, to give an eternal Inſtance of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he commands all the Angels of God to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, and to worſhip him with the greateſt Proſtration and Adoration imaginable; for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, uſed upon this occaſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates. That the Apoſtle ſhould treat ſo much, when he is dealing with the <hi>Jews,</hi> of the Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Chriſt above the Angels, we may well conceive, when we conſider, that he himſelf in this Epiſtle declares, that the Law was the Word ſpoken by the Angels, and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. ſays, that <hi>it was ordained by angels, in the hand of a mediator;</hi> not as if this were to be taken, as <hi>Grotius</hi> and ſome learned men have conceived, that the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was originally given forth by a created Angel there, for it was moſt certainly publiſhed authoritatively by God himſelf there preſent; nor is it any where ſaid to be original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given forth by Angels, but to be ſpoken by them, and given forth by their Manage and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry: In the 68th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> we are told, <hi>The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of God are twenty thouſand, even thouſands of thouſands, the Lord is among them, as in Sinai:</hi> by which 'tis evident enough, the glorious and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Jehovah</hi> was there perſonally preſent, after a very peculiar and eminent manner: And in <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>'s laſt Sermon, he tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> in that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Recapitulation of their whole Affairs, that they had received the Law by the <hi>diſpoſition of Angels, and had not kept it.</hi> So that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59586:15"/>is, the delivery of the Law was by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Angels, and their ordering of things upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> though it was uttered by God himſelf; but the delivery of the Goſpel is ſingly by the Miniſtry of the Son of God in perſon: And when we are told the Law was the Word <hi>ſpoken by Angels, and that it was ordained by Angels,</hi> it is in this ſenſe, and no other to be underſtood; and well may it be ſo ſtiled, if we reflect upon theſe ſeveral things:</p>
            <p n="1">1st, The whole heavenly Hoaſt of Angels, thoſe glorious Guards of Spirits, that attend the Eternal <hi>Jehovah,</hi> were all there preſent in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and particular manner, (ſuch as we no where elſe read of) in their courſes, and order, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute what their Supream Lord came about, and beholding with wonder and admiration, the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Supream Legiſlator, in giving forth thoſe wiſe Laws to the World, upon which the legal Diſpenſation was chiefly founded; which was the reaſon, perhaps, made them ſo earneſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, to look down into the Goſpel Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, [having ſeen ſo much of the legal, and been ſuch Actors in it] and behold the glory of that, for by it the Apoſtle tells us expreſly, <hi>the manifold wiſdom of God is made known unto them;</hi> and by beholding the ſecond Perſon incarnate, they ſaw ſomewhat more of Heaven upon Earth, then they could ſee in Heaven it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, It was by the Miniſtry of Angels that thoſe prodigious Terrors were effected, by which the People were ſo aw'd, and taught to reverence the Law, God raiſed by them the Smoak, and the Fire, at Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly, It was they that ſhook and rent the Rock.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59586:16"/>
            <p n="4">4thly, It was they that ſounded the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet:</p>
            <p>And, 5thly, [from the conſideration of which the great Emphaſis of the Apoſtle's Speech chiefly ariſeth] 'twas they framed and effected the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Voices and Words from God, by which he ſpake to the People, and by which the Law was conveyed to their Ears, that is, the Angels recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Law from God's Mouth, and uttered it by Sounds and Expreſſions to the People, and thereby became ſo the publiſhers of the Law, as that it is truly and very properly called <hi>the word ſpoken by Angels:</hi> and may be very ſignificantly ſaid, to be ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator.</p>
            <p>'T will be a thing in its nature moſt inſtructing, and full of the greateſt ſpiritual delight and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to conſider over the Apoſtles firſt Point, thoſe glorious Excellencies of Chriſt that are apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainant unto him, by which he hath the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all that went before him, and by which he is infinitely exalted beyond what ever can poſſibly ſucceed him; and therefore a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, and a Religion ſetled by him, muſt needs, with the ſupreameſt Authority, command our utmoſt obedience.</p>
            <p>Firſt he informs us, of two tranſcendent, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent and unparalled Qualifications of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Perſon by whom God now ſpeaks; firſt, that he hath appointed him Heir of all things; and, ſecondly, that by him, he made the Worlds. The firſt of theſe relates chiefly to his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Humanity, and as he is Man, this is an eternal ſtatute of the Trinity, that the ſecond Perſon humbling himſelf to become Man,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59586:16"/>and aſſuming the Humane Nature to the Divine, as he was Man, ſhould be Heir of the whole Creation, and inherit as a Prince and a Saviour all created Supremacy and Glory, and therefore he himſelf often affirms in St. <hi>John,</hi> that <hi>all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and judgment is given unto him,</hi> upon this very account, becauſe he is the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> [a Title only given to him in Scripture by himſelf and by no other, and another expreſſion of the <hi>Seed of the Woman]</hi> that very Humane Nature that look'd ſo meanly, and was ſuch a ſtumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block to the Faith of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the <hi>Gentils,</hi> had annexed unto it, the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Dominion of all, this could not ſimply belong to the Humane Nature in it ſelf, but was by Divine Ordination of the Father, by him of whom the whole Family in Heaven and Earth is named; and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>God has appointed him heir of all things,</hi> and by this inſinuates to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that if he were Heir of all things, then has he power in the Church to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſettle what Religion he pleaſeth, diſpoſe of their Eccleſiaſtick Fabrick as he thought good, and that if they did intend to keep thoſe eminent and peculiar Priviledges they had above the reſt of the World, they muſt own him, and enjoy all from him, and under him, becauſe God has ordained him Heir of all things.</p>
            <p>But the ſecond is that I ſhall chiefly inſiſt on, by which the Apoſtle inculcates his Divinity, <hi>that by him God made the worlds;</hi> this is a diſcovery that at firſt view ſeems rather to ſtupifie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe [the Object ſo far exceeding the Faculty] than any way to encourage us to contemplate, or enquire, or farther to think over this matter,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59586:17"/>nor can any one Meditation about it be drawn from any other Topick, than pure Revelation; this is a great Oracle let fall from Heaven for the inſtruction of the Church, and we muſt with all humble and thankful adoration, enquire how far the Holy Ghoſt has inform'd us in this matter, and not farther gaze, leſt we loſe our ſelves in vain, fruitleſs and unbecoming Speculations.</p>

               <hi>By whom alſo he made the worlds.</hi> By the Worlds, is not meant as ſome have conceived, ſeveral Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of the ſame World, but 'tis meant in the ſenſe the <hi>Jews</hi> took the word, to whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle accommodates himſelf, and they reckoned upon three Worlds, that above, of Angels and Spirits; that beneath them, of Sun, Moon and Stars; and this inferior World in which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe: the Apoſtles drift is to ſhew, that what was any where created, was created and made by him, and that according to St. <hi>John, without him was nothing made that was made;</hi> and this appears to be his meaning from <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. <hi>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, viſible and inviſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>[By whom]</hi> not as a created inſtrument any way inferior to himſelf, ſo it cannot be taken, for we are told by Sr. <hi>John,</hi> that the <hi>word by which all things were made, was in the beginning with God, and was God,</hi> but by him as his own eternal Word, Wiſdom, and Power; that is to ſay, the making of the World was an act peculiar to the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, and the whole Deity in making the World, acted by the ſecond Perſon, for 'tis not ſaid abſolutely, that Chriſt made the World, but God by him; which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies to us the order of working in the Trinity,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59586:17"/>and the diſtinct ſubſiſtence and operations of the perſons, and not bare inſtrumentality: True it is, that the act of each Perſon in the Trinity is in ſome ſenſe the act of all the three, yet by the Trinity a threefold Record is ſaid to be born in Heaven, and diſtinct acts are applied to each of the three, and God does appear to us under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct actings in the ſame eternal and bleſſed Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence by that threefold Record.</p>
            <p>To make this deep and important Point as plain and overt as we can, the beſt way is to view over thoſe Scriptures where the Holy Ghoſt treats moſt expreſly touching this matter; St. <hi>John</hi> begins his Goſpel with a great diſcovery of it, <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God, the ſame was in the beginning with God; all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.</hi> The Apoſtle's deſign in this Goſpel, is evidently to begin it with the Divinity and Godhead of Chriſt, as the reſt had begun theirs with the Original and Hiſtory of his Humanity and Incarnation; and this Declaration of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity muſt needs be very ſhort, for no man can write a Hiſtory of God, or make any Narrative of his Eternal Exiſtence, the Apoſtle therefore in a few words tells us all that was needful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be told about his Divinity, and all that could be known about the Man Chriſt Jeſus, as he was God, <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. [In the beginning]</hi> 'tis an alluſion to what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays about the Creation, <hi>In the beginning God made the heavens and the earth;</hi> that is, before any thing created was extant; and ſo here St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>In
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59586:18"/>the beginning was the word,</hi> that is, Chriſt was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant when all things elſe began; and ſo he was, and was in being before them, and did not then begin to be; he was before time, or any thing that was created had a beginning, 'tis in a ſhort way to expreſs him eternal, the expreſſion [that he was] is evidently taken out of the 8th Chapter of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> from the 23d to the 31ſt Verſe, where the <hi>Word</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, is repreſented as preſent with God in all the Buſineſs that relates to this World, and principally and eſpecially in the work of Redemption, <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old, I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was, when there was no depths I was brought forth, when there was no fountains abounding with water;</hi> and in the 30th Verſe, <hi>Then I was with him, as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight, rejoycing always before him, rejoycing in the habitable parts of this Earth, and my delights were with the ſons of men;</hi> of which we can conceive no more, but that God's Works being known unto him and preſent with him from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>the Word</hi> the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, by whom they were to be made, managed, and finally diſpoſed, was with him in that particular concern and relation from all eternity, and God took the ſame complacency in them, as if they had been actually in being; the Apoſtle's words are a plain Syllogiſm, Chriſt was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, not created, but exiſting before all created beings, <hi>And was;</hi> and if you ask where he was, he was with God, and therefore muſt needs be God, upon theſe premiſes, that Chriſt was before all, and was with God. It may be undeniably
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59586:18"/>concluded, he was God, for nothing but God, could precede all beginning, and creation, and exiſt with himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[Was the Word.]</hi> The Reaſons why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle chuſeth to expreſs Chriſt when he writes of his Divinity by the name of the <hi>Word,</hi> ſeem to be two, and they both reſult from that other undeniable evidence he gives of his Divinity, that he was not only before the World with God, but that the World was actually made by him, and that without him nothing was made that was made: The firſt reaſon of his being called the Word, is becauſe words are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of Ourſelves, of our Wiſdom, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and Will, and ſo was Chriſt the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of God, the Deity in that work of creation utter'd and expreſs'd it ſelf in its eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wiſdom, Councels and Will, by the ſecond Perſon, as the voice of all the three, and ſo he is called the <hi>Word.</hi> Secondly, He is called the <hi>Word</hi> with particular reference to the Hiſtory <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us of the manner of Creation; the Creatures were all originally framed by God's ſpeaking, for ſays he, <hi>God ſaid</hi> of every thing, <hi>let it be, and it was;</hi> he ſaid, <hi>let there be light, and it was ſo.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſpeaking of the Creation expreſſeth it thus, <hi>He ſpake, and it was done, he commanded, and it ſtood fast,</hi> Pſal. 33.9. God ſpake, and the Creation was effected; the method of it is ſo repreſented, and it being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the ſecond Perſon, and God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſolely by him, he is thence called the Word. And this ſeems to be all the knowledge we can attain to about this deep and profound Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59586:19"/>and we muſt know withal, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is metaphorical, and ſuted to our frame and capacity.</p>
            <p>In the firſt of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> from the 15th Verſe to the 19th, we find the Apoſtle's expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion very full in this matter, who is [ſays he] <hi>the image of the inviſible God, and the firſt-born of every creature; for by him were all things created, which are in heaven, and that are in earth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be thrones or dominions, or principalities or powers, all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt, and he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning and firſt-born from the dead, that in [or among] all things he might have the pre eminence.</hi> In the 15th Verſe the Apoſtle lays down theſe two deep and grand fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Truths: Firſt, That he is <hi>the image of the inviſible God,</hi> the ſame that he affirms in the firſt of this Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, That he is the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon:</hi> And, Secondly, <hi>That he is the first-born of every creature.</hi> The Apoſtle's meaning in the firſt of theſe, in both Texts, is principally to aſſert and prove the Divinity of Chriſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the faſhion of a Man, and to give us to underſtand, that the ſecond Perſon in the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty united unto the Humanity, though he be ſo diſtinct from the Father, as that the Father and he bear a diſtinct and twofold Record, yet he is eſſentially God, and has all the Qualifications of the Deity appurtenant unto him, he is the brightneſs of his Father's glory. Now his glory is the radiation of his excellency, and Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59586:19"/>the brightneſs of his glory, is the perfection of his glory, and ſo an eſſential part of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in that conjunction of God and Man wherein he is viſible, he is the very Image of the inviſible God, and repreſents the inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and inviſible Deity unto us, [the great thing the Wiſdom and Philoſophy both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſtumbled at] and renders it the object of our knowledge, our delight, our communion, and unutterable ſatisfaction: the Humane and Divine Nature being united in one perſon, and making and conſtituting but one Perſon, he that ſees what is viſible and can be ſeen in that Perſon, is ſaid and truly ſo to ſee that Perſon, as he that ſees a Man, is truly ſaid to ſee the whole Man, though he do not actually ſee the Soul of that Man, nor diſtinctly and particularly the Underſtanding, Will and Affections of which that Man is conſtituted, but by their effects in corporeal Operations, the Deity was as viſible in the Humane Perſon of Chriſt, as the Soul is in the Fabrick of any Man we converſe with; and in this ſenſe our Saviour himſelf ſays, he that ſeen him hath ſeen the Father, by the Effects, and his Mighty Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he that ſees that Perſon where the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead dwells bodily, has ſeen God himſelf, that is, has ſeen that expreſs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Image of his Perſon, ſet forth for us to converſe with him by, and through which the Godhead acts and ſhews it ſelf by its omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent effects, according to that of St. <hi>John, No man hath ſeen God at any time, the only begotten ſon in the boſom of the father he declares him;</hi> that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59586:20"/>is, the Humane Nature of Chriſt united to the Deity, is that Image whereby God is pleas'd to reveal and manifeſt himſelf to us, and all that is acted in, by, and through that Image, is the Actings of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle ſays he is the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of every creature, by which the Apoſtle no way refers to the order of time in which things were made, but his meaning is, that his Humane Nature in that conjunction with the Divine, has the preference to all Humane Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, God has given him the right of Primoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, and the Dominion appurtenant to the Firſt-born, and made him Heir of all things, as he is ſaid in the 89th <hi>Pſalm</hi> to <hi>make David his firſt-born, higher than all the kings of the earth,</hi> not by any priority of Time, nor by vertue of that Dominion he had in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> but as he was a Type and Repreſentation of Chriſt, who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, God has made the Man Chriſt Jeſus Lord of the whole Creation, and given him the precedence of all things in Heaven and Earth; St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>he is gone into heaven, angels, and authorities, and powers being made ſubject unto him:</hi> and this as being his Firſt-born from all Eternity in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and as our Saviour ſtiles himſelf, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the creation of God, he decreeing from everlaſting, that all that ſhould be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhould be created by him, and not only ſo, but <hi>for him,</hi> and be entirely his property, as he was the bleſſed Mediator God and Man in one perſon: In a word, he is the Firſt-born amongſt the Elect, they are all choſen in him, the eldeſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59586:20"/>Brother in the Family of God, whereunto is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd the Dominion and Power over the whole Creation, whence he is called the Firſt-born of every Creature.</p>
            <p>What is more briefly expreſſed by St. <hi>John,</hi> that all was created by him that was created, and what is in few words ſaid in this Epiſtle, that by him God made the Worlds, is here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by the Apoſtle into particulars, ſhewing that all Creatures both in Heaven and Earth, <hi>whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or powers,</hi> they were all made by him, the Apoſtle inſtanceth in the nobleſt and higheſt ſort of Creatures as comprehenſive of all the reſt, even all the Supream Rulers and Governours amongſt Angels and Men, all were created by him, and for him, and he is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt, as their Maker he muſt needs precede them, and by whom they were originally created, by him they muſt needs live, move, and have their being.</p>
            <p>And as he is the Sourſe of all Natural Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo he is the Spring of the New Creature, and of all Spiritual Life, being called in the 18th Verſe, <hi>the head of his body, the church, the firſt-born from the dead:</hi> he that firſt roſe himſelf as victorious over the Grave, and by whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, as an effect of that Victory, all others ſhall riſe, that in both the Creations, both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Spiritual, in the whole concerns of this World and the next, he might have the pre-eminence, <hi>for it pleaſed the father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell,</hi> that that bleſſed Perſon, our Saviour and Mediator, ſhould be as full of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59586:21"/>perfection and as glorious as all the glory of Heaven and Earth created and uncreated could poſſibly make him.</p>
            <p>The moſt material difficulty that ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from theſe Illuminations, the Holy Ghoſt has been pleaſed to give us in Scripture touching theſe matters, is this, If the Divinity and the Humanity in that conjunction, conſtitute but one intire perſon, how can ſo much be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſtinctly aſcribed to Chriſt as Man, all things muſt needs belong to him as God; but the Holy Ghoſt makes them appurtenant to him as Man: the Reaſons of which ſeem moſt probably to be theſe,</p>
            <p>Firſt, To Honour and Recommend to the World, that Humane Nature Chriſt debaſed himſelf to aſſume, that becauſe he in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture performed the Work of the Mediator, and all the ſuffering part lay upon that; therefore God has highly exalted it above all created things.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe all the additional Glory that accrued unto Chriſt by vertue of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Law of his Mediatorſhip, muſt needs fall upon his Humanity, for there could be no addition made, nor nothing accrue cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulative to his Divinity, nothing could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him as God, and therefore 'tis attributed to him as Man.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Conſtitution of Chriſt as he appeared viſibly to the World, and wherein he acted all, <hi>was Man,</hi> the Propheſies and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that preceded him pointed to him as Man, the Humanity was the Temple of the Deity,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59586:21"/>in the Humanity he ſuffered, died, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and performed all his Mediatory Work, 'twas all promiſed and deſigned to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Man, viſibly, and Humane more, though acted by the ſecond Perſon in the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore all the Glory is attributed in Scripture to his Humane part, without which the Work of Redemption could not have been effected; ſo we have it in the 5th of <hi>John,</hi> all Authority is there ſaid by Chriſt himſelf to be given to him, <hi>Becauſe he is the ſon of man;</hi> which Expreſſion I take to relate to his Office, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, which he could not have performed had he not been Man; and ſo the ſenſe of it is this, that becauſe Chriſt is the true Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that real Son of Man propheſied of by the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> by whom the World is to be redeemed and ſaved; therefore all the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy and Authority appurtenant to that Office, by God's ordination, belongs to him.</p>
            <p>From what hath been diſcourſed upon this Argument, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is he by whom all things were originally created, we may arrive at a twofold concluſion, and ſafely eſtabliſh theſe two moſt important Truths.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Foundation of all God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and his Eternal Councels and Purpoſes, touching Angels and Men, and the whole that was made by him, was laid in his creation of all by the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity.</p>
            <p>And, Secondly, That all the Works of the firſt Creation, were ſo framed and made, that they might lye in a direct ſubſerviency to the new Creation, and the manifeſtation of God's
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59586:22"/>infinite Grace in redeeming and ſaving the World by the ſecond Perſon becoming Man and incarnate.</p>
            <p>I ſhall apply my ſelf chiefly to the former of theſe: Our diſcovery of this Matter is a <hi>parte poſt,</hi> no Man was converſant with God's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels from everlaſting, all Men are eternally ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced with God's Queſtion and Demand to <hi>Job,</hi> he may ſay to all, as he ſaid to him, <hi>Where were ye when I laid the foundations of the earth?</hi> where were the Councels of your Hearts? where were your Thoughts and Contrivances then? ye were ſo far from inſtructing or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the Almighty, that ye were not in being, nor knew any thing what he was about to do; what we know therefore, is what God is pleaſed ſince to reveal to us, and from the providential future effects which our eyes behold, from both which we are plentifully inſtructed herein; <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed in his Writings is ſilent about this matter, the full Relation of it was reſerved for the Days of the Goſpel, when it came to be known how, and by whom, the World was to be redeemed, then we are more particularly told how, and by whom it was made, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Perſon of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, as the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of all, the Beginning and the Ending of the Creation of God, in whom there is a recapitulation of the whole, God deſigning after things were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, diſorder'd and loſt by ſin, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to bring all, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Angels and Men, the whole Creation into one Head, and under one Rule in him, as the Apoſtle expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59586:22"/>it in the firſt of the <hi>Epheſians, that he might gather together in one, all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are one arth, even in him:</hi> and ſo as God was pleaſed to make all by him, he recovers all back again through him, and under him.</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing this deep and myſterious Point, what ever advance is made towards the right underſtanding of it, be it never ſo ſmall, the deſign ought to be in every ſtep that is taken, to do it with perſpicuity and evidence, that ſo it may not be rendred a Notion obſcure and uſeleſs, but a Truth wherein the comfort, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and intereſt of every Chriſtian may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear much concerned.</p>
            <p>And in order to this, I will take a diſtinct and threefold Conſideration of all the Works of God's Hands: 1st, Of the Angels; 2ly, Of Mankind; 3ly, Of all the reſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Two things are eminently and principally to be conſidered about the Creation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; 1st, That they were ſo made, that ſome of them might apoſtatize and fall, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them ſhould keep their firſt and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtation: 2ly, That all of them ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lordſhip and Dominion of Chriſt, as the great Recoverer of Mankind, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and Head of the Church, <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Creation gives us no account of the Angels, nor does the New Teſtament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us any thing of the manner of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that when they were made, in what part of the ſix days, or how, whether of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſting
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59586:23"/>Matter, or as the Soul of Man and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the Creation, without any ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſting Matter, and whether when made, they had all an equal viſion and fruition of God [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeems difficult to conceive how any created Being could turn aſide from that Viſion] or whether they ſinned in God's preſence and in <hi>foro Coeli,</hi> becauſe their Judgment is ſo heavy and irreverſible, are things unrevealed, by the Scriptures paſſed over in ſilence, nor can they by ſearching, or any humane endeavour be found out.</p>
            <p>The Angels that fell being of the nobleſt nature and complexion, neareſt unto God of any that he made, and of greateſt power and influence, their fall was it that firſt introduced Sin and Apoſtacy amongſt Men, and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Rebellion of this lower World againſt God; and upon that account we are told by St. <hi>John, for this cauſe was the Son of God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, that he might deſtory the works of the devil:</hi> as comprehenſive of all the Apoſtaſie both of Angels and Men; and therefore it is, that they firſt fell of all other Creatures under the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Dominion of Chriſt as Mediator, by vertue of that declaratory Promiſe, [from which the mediatory Dominion of Chriſt bears actual date] <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpents head.</hi> Hence it came to paſs that the apoſtate Angels, who by the Temptations they laid before our firſt Parents and ſo early aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted them withal, appeared to be of an aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Temper, and not contented with that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtation, which by their firſt and original
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59586:23"/>make they were placed in, but attempted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing farther, beyond thoſe bounds God by the Law of their Creation had confined them to, [which could be nothing elſe but to deifie themſelves, for God had already made them above every thing but himſelf] they fell from that glory they had received from the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity [by whom they were made] as God, into an abſolute ſubjection to him, [as his Enemies and Vaſſals] as he was Man, and by God's moſt juſt, wiſe, and holy Judgment, ſaw themſelves ſubjected to that very Nature, they ſo maliciouſly [with reſpect both to God and Man] ſought the ruine of; and the ſame Nature wonderfully aſſumed to the Divine, by the ſecond Perſon, and in that glorious and ſplendid Conjunction, the World recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and a Dominion eſtabliſhed over all the Rebellions, Apoſtaſies, and Declenſions, both of Angels and Men.</p>
            <p>The Devil having been thus a Lyar and a Rebel from the beginning, and uſing all the fraudulent endeavours poſſible, to have all the Creation [to their final and utmoſt Ruine] his Aſſociates therein, and God having been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, to encounter all his Deſigns and Endeavours by the ſecond Perſon incarnate, whom he conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes a Prince and a Saviour, and ſets him as his King upon his Holy Hill, and declares his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree from everlaſting, to eſtabliſh his Kingdom with all Authority and Power; the World has been ever ſince under a twofold Dominion, that of Satan, and that of Chriſt; and theſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59586:24"/>two Kingdoms, that of the Fallen Angels, and that of the Mediator, have ſtood in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and in all Ages conteſted each other, the Conteſt grew high very early in the World, and continued ſo till the Flood; the four great Monarchies ſince have all ofthem been Satan's Allies and Inſtruments, and Factors for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, not only by their multiply'd Idolatries, thereby throwing [as much as in them lay] the true God out of the World, but by their proud and inſolent defiance of him, and placing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in his room upon all occaſions: To what inconceivable Inſolence and Pride were thoſe firſt <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchs arrived at? we need no other account of it, but to read what the Prophet <hi>Eſaw</hi> tells them, <hi>Thou haſt ſaid in thine heart, I will aſcend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the ſtars of God, I will ſit alſo upon the mount of the congregation, in the ſides of the north, I will aſcend above the heighths of the clouds, I will be like the Moſt High.</hi> The <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, that next ſucceeded, much affected to retain and improve the Grandeur and Heighth of their Predeceſſors, and if it were poſſible to out do them; one Inſtance they gave of that, in which they greatly prided and valued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which was to make their Laws unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> were not to be changed, as if they had arrived at once to all the Wiſdom and Foreſight of God himſelf. The folly of this inſolent Project, of this vain Exaltation of Humane Wiſdom and Power beyond its due bounds, and ſetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſupreme Legiflator's place, the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59586:24"/>Scripture has ſufficiently recorded to its eternal ſhame and confuſion, in one Inſtance we have of it in the Book of <hi>Eſthers: Ahaſuerus,</hi> upon the Petition of <hi>Haman,</hi> made an Edict, that all the <hi>Jews</hi> in his Territories ſhould be upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed day ſlain and deſtroyed; after, upon the Petition of <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Eſther,</hi> he altered his purpoſe, and had a mind to have all the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaved; the firſt Law could not be altered nor reverſed by their fundamental Conſtitution, and therefore <hi>Abaſuerus</hi> had no other way, but he makes another Law after the ſame form and manner that he made the former, wherein 'tis thus decreed, <hi>The king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themſelves together, and to ſtand for their lives, to deſtroy, to ſlay and cauſe to periſh all the power of the people and province that ſhould aſſault them, both little ones and women, and take the ſpoil of them for a prey.</hi> By which he downright ſettles a Civil War by two unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Laws in the Bowels of his Dominions, and in all his Territories commands his Subjects to maſſacre and deſtroy each other, nay, even in his own Palace, for upon this ſecond Edict the <hi>Jews</hi> ſlew 500 Men in <hi>Shuſan</hi> the King's Palace. The laſt Monarchy of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſo far advanced Idolatry and carried on Satan's concerns, that they ranſack'd the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Deities, and arrived to Thirty thouſand Gods, and the Emperors came to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of impudent Pride and Impiety, as down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to deifie themſelves; the Kingdoms and Powers of the World have lain from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his hands, and therefore 'tis ſaid upon
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59586:25"/>the full recovery of the World, <hi>The kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ:</hi> the Kingdom of the Mediator has conſiſted but of a few, it pleaſing God in his infinite Wiſdom to declare the glory of that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in quality than quantity.</p>
            <p>This Kingdom of the fallen Angels is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called in Scripture, the Kingdom of Darkneſs, and ſometimes the Kingdom of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and he is himſelf ſometimes called the Prince of this World, and the Prince of the Power of the Air, that old Serpent the Devil and Satan which deceiveth the World; the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of it was Apoſtaſie and Rebellion againſt the Supreme Soveraign, and an endeavour to ſet up a Counter-Soveraignty in the creature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and 'tis carried on and will be till the end of his Reign, with all poſſible counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working to the Kingdom of the Mediator, and all the gracious and glorious Deſigns and Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God therein.</p>
            <p>The chief of the fallen Angels is reckon'd the Prince of this Kingdom, and all the fallen Angels and fallen Men (unrecovered) are embodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it as his Subjects; 'tis carried on and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe two things, Firſt, A malignant Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, for his manage of the whole Affairs of the Creation by the ſecond Perſon incarnate: And, Secondly, By an inſatiable appetite to throw off all Bonds and Ties of Obedience to their Supreme Soveraign and Maker, and enjoy the uninterrupted poſſeſſion of a lawleſs Life, ſutable to their degenerate and apoſtate Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The woful ſtate they arrive at by this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59586:25"/>[to let us know no Man can oppoſe God and proſper] is, Firſt, Ever to labour and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with a certainty of diſappointment, for the fallen Angels know very well their purpoſes and deſigns ſhall never be accompliſhed. And, Secondly, To lye under a conſtant ſenſe of ill doing, and under guilt and terror in what ever they act: And, Thirdly, To ſtand bound over to the dreadful Juſtice of God, and be ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the Judgment-Seat by that Man whom he hath appointed, to the endleſs and utmoſt Miſery and Horror, of all which the fallen Angels and many of their adherents are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently informed.</p>
            <p>From the beginning God has not been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſet himſelf at any time againſt this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his confederate Enemies and Rebbels, by the Thunder of his Power, and as it were moſt eaſie for him to do, in a moment to grind them to Powder, but in the profound depths of his Wiſdom, [who is wonderful in councel and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in working] ſuffers the continuance of it for great and holy ends and purpoſes, and oppoſeth it [and will at laſt utterly ruine it] by a ſtill ſmall voice, in thoſe Methods by which the Mediator's Kingdom is to be erected, that is, the Laws of his Grace, and the mighty Influences of his Spirit; and hence it is, that in every Generation we find a continued conteſt and oppoſition between the renewed and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered part of the World, and all apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men, God conteſting by his Grace and Spirit in the Hearts of his Servants, all the violent Aſſaults that the Powers of Darkneſs,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59586:26"/>the whole Race of degenerate Angels or Men could bring upon them; and upon that account, has had ſome faithful Servants in all Ages, upon whoſe Fidelity and Ability in this way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, he has ſtak'd down his Intereſt, and with whom he has truſted his Glory, nor can he by this Method ever fail of the Glory due to him, or by ſuch an Adventure ever come ſhort of it, for 'tis truſting his Glory with his Grace, and the one ſtands upon as ſure a foundation as the other, and both in their nature immoveable. Inſtances of this kind the Scriptures abound withal, but that which in a particular caſe ſeems the moſt eminent of them all, and moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is the Caſe of <hi>Job</hi> and the Tryal he went through.</p>
            <p>Whoever will nicely conſider his Caſe, ſhall find it a Story of wonderful diſtinction and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, the whole Buſineſs of Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by conſent put upon tryal in him: <hi>Job</hi> was declared by God himſelf, [and Satan deny'd it not] to be the beſt Man then living, one that had not his like in all the Earth; but Satan ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects unto God againſt him, and affirms, that though he was ſo eminent, and had the priority of all the Religious Party then extant, yet all his Religion was but Hypocriſie, built upon a ſecular bottom, and that if God brought him once to tryal, it would appear ſo to be, and himſelf manifeſted thereby to be a moſt noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Hypocrite and Diſſembler: Had this in reality proved true, Satan had carried his point, for it had been an undeniable evidence, that God had had no faithful Servants, nor had there
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59586:26"/>been any ſuch thing as true and ſincere Piety and Religion in the World; for if the very beſt of all Men proved upon tryal but a rotten falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Hypocrite, the conſequence had been very plain, that all the reſt of the ſame profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt needs have been much more ſo: The tryal proceeds with all the poſſible advantage Satan could wiſh to obtain his end, and he is permitted to go to the utmoſt extent of all the Artifices he had, in order to ſtir up and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke in <hi>Job,</hi> all the exorbitant Paſſions, unruly Ferments, and irreligious profane Workings that belong to Humane Nature, and uſually appear upon ſuch occaſions, in order to bring him to calumniatè Providence, and even reproach God himſelf:</p>
            <p n="1">1st, By Afflicting his Body; 2ly, By Ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Eſtate; And, 3ly, By laying him, as to his preſent ſtate and condition, under the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Judgments and ſevereſt Cenſures of his beſt and moſt devout Friends; yet for all this, and all that Satan could do by himſelf or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, yet the Grace of Sincerity [the main thing Satan ſtruck at] carried him triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through all, to the utter confuſion of Satan and all his malicious Charges againſt him; ſuch a Sincerity he appeared to have as is the Badge of God's <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that Mark whereby the Lord knows thoſe that are his: <hi>Job</hi> indeed diſcovered much Weakneſs, and manifold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, [which belong to the beſt Servants God has, ſo gracious is he in his acceptance of them] but that was in no ſort the Point under queſtion, whether <hi>Job</hi> were a Man of Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59586:27"/>or no, but the Matter put upon tryal was, whether <hi>Job</hi> was an Hypocrite or no, and in the main of his ſtate and condition one under allegiance to Satan, or a true and faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Servant to God, and that was by the carriage of the whole buſineſs clearly determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt Satan, by <hi>Job's</hi> perfect and intire Submiſſion unto God, [ſo far was he from Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to his Face] and total Reſignation of himſelf to him in a way of truſt and affiance, though he ſhould proceed to kill him, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of himſelf to the utmoſt in his Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and keeping his Integrity throughout his whole Exerciſe and Tryal clear and untainted to the very laſt, and rancountering Satan's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation with that holy ſubmiſſion in the very heighth of his Agony, when the News of all his Misfortunes at once came upon him, <hi>The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh, and bleſſed be the Name of the Lord;</hi> than which Expreſſion nothing could more poſitively and expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute all the Charges and Accuſations Satan brought againſt him, for he declared quite contrary to Satan's ſuggeſtions, ſo far was he from Curſing God to his Face, and therefore the Holy Ghoſt immediately records the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory on <hi>Job's</hi> ſide in the next Verſe, <hi>In all this Job ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the greateſt, moſt general, and moſt powerful Conteſt, that ever happened between the Strength and Force of theſe Kingdoms, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the laſt of all, wherein Satan with all the Powers that belong to his Kingdom, will diſcover himſelf in his ſtrongeſt and utmoſt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59586:27"/>and wherein he will at laſt periſh, this is by a ſpiritual <hi>Babylon</hi> reared up by him in the days of the Goſpel, and a Syſtem of Religion compoſed by him, to encounter the Mediator withal in his own way; this was the grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Project, when the Goſpel began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt all oppoſition, and Temporal Power would ſerve the Devil's turn no longer; and herein he proves ſo ſucceſsful, as to delude and intoxicate the Nations of the Earth, and make them drunk with his Compoſitions, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a ſpiritual and mighty Monarchy, now of great and long continuance, founded upon wonderful Artifice and Strength; this was the great Secret revealed of old, to that greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> that out of the fourth and laſt Temporal Monarchy of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould ariſe another Monarchy, upon the diſſolution of that, diverſe from all the reſt, <hi>that ſhould mightily prevail, ſpeak great words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Moſt High, wear out the ſaints, change times and laws, and continue his power until a time and times and the dividing of time:</hi> [which is after punctually explained in Scripture to be 1260 Years, the exact time of this Monarchy's continuance] and ſhould by a mighty Power in Spirituals, reſemble the great Power the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchs had in Temporals, have the ſame ſituation, and much the ſame ſubjects in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, that the other had in Temporals: This is the Popiſh Fabrick, the erecting of which is the Maſter-piece of Satan, and the greateſt Effect of the Wiſdom and Proceſs of the fallen Angels ſince they left their firſt ſtate, who have with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59586:28"/>their utmoſt vigor employed themſelves herein; and the affirmation of this cannot ſeem ſtrange, ſince we are directly told by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>that the coming of the man of ſin is after the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The caſe was plainly this: The Meſſiah ſo often promiſed from the beginning, in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time (that is, in the exact time wherein all the Predictions of his coming did concenter) comes, and aſſumes Humane Nature, compleats the work of Man's Redemption, and by one Offering for ever perfects them that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, proclaims the Goſpel, publiſhes a new Law of Grace, and iſſues out a general Proclamation for all the World both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception to come in, and upon the terms of this new recovering Law to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Satan very ſenſibly feeling this fatal Blow, and finding his Kingdom fundamentally ſtruck at, and that unleſs fome new Infernal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels were taken up, his intereſt could not lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be ſupported, turns every ſtone to invert and invalidate this gracious Deſign of God, and this glorious Kingdom of the Mediator now ſhining forth in its native luſtre and ſplendor. To deny the Fact, would have made him ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and to endeavour to ſtop the Succeſs of the Goſpel if it went on, he well knew was impoſſible; and therefore reſolves upon this Method as his laſt and only Remedy, to Plow with Chriſt's Heifer, to Erect a Religion ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly founded upon the Goſpel, and extreamly like it, that yet ſhould be deſtructive to all the ends of it, and by this to ſuperſede the Goſpel
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59586:28"/>it ſelf, and have this falſe and ſpurious counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part taken in the room of it, this is the Papacy, a falſe dead Image of the Chriſtian Religion, animated by the ſpirit of Satan, and a thing in its nature utterly ruinous and deſtructive to it.</p>
            <p>This Structure in Scripture is called <hi>Babylon,</hi> with reference to the firſt <hi>Babel,</hi> being like that ſet up in direct oppoſition to God, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front his Authority: As God is pleaſed that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where his Worſhip and Ordinances were ſo ſolemnly ſetled, by his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall keep up its Name and denominate the true Church throughout all Generations to the very end of the World, ſo he is pleaſed to ſtigmatize the Name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and by it emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and emphatically to denominate the very worſt of his Enemies until Chriſt's ſecond co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and the period of all; the Names that are given to this Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy, [for there be ſeveral others though <hi>Babylon</hi> be the chief] the Holy Ghoſt inſtructs us that they are ſpiritually to be underſtood, and relate to its ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical Abominations; when 'tis called <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi> 'tis to ſignifie the Filth of it, and the cruel Bondage the Saints undergo there; when 'tis called and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denominated <hi>Babylon,</hi> 'tis to ſignifie its Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, Tyranny, and Idolatry, all which were eminent in that Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Although this Spiritual Monarchy ariſe out of the aſhes of the fourth and laſt Temporal Monarchy of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet St. <hi>John</hi> writing during the continuance of that Monarchy, the Holy
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59586:29"/>Ghoſt chuſeth to repreſent it by that firſt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and there: ſeems to be a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar reſemblance between this Eccleſiaſtical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and that, and that in ſeveral things:</p>
            <p n="1">1st, In the continuance and time of its dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 1260 Years, being near about the time that the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy laſted.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, In reſpect that all the holy and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Utenſils of the Temple were captived in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and there prophaned as all the Sacred Inſtitutions of the Goſpel are captived and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned in this Myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> how ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully have the Sacraments of Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper, and the other Holy Inſtitutions and Ordinances of the New Teſtament been prophan'd and abus'd under the Papal Reign?</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, This Eccleſiaſtical Mornarchy is ſet forth and deſcribed by that of the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> after a very peculiar manner, in reſpect of the ſore Perſecutions the Church meets with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both, the Holy Ghoſt makes the one typical and repreſentative of the other.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, The <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy was not ruined by a common Providence, but by pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and extraordinary Judgments; they are three times in one Chapter called the <hi>Vengeance of his Temple.</hi> And ſo ſhall this Papal <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> State be ruined after a peculiar manner, by the brightneſs of Chriſt's coming, and by the glory of his Power.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly, And that which I think the principal Reaſon why the Holy Ghoſt brands this Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Monarchy with the Name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> though it aroſe out of the Ruins of the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59586:29"/>Monarchy, and have its ſituation at <hi>Rome,</hi> is this, to keep up and maintain the Harmony and due decorum of the Viſions ſet forth in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the Repreſentations and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions thereof: Now it is plain, that in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the true Church is repreſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel by <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Similitudes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and the Enemies of it are repreſented in the Names of thoſe great Enemies the <hi>Jews</hi> had to their Church and State. The three moſt remarkable Calamities that befel the <hi>Jews,</hi> was firſt in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſecondly in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and thirdly from the Outrages of <hi>Antiochus;</hi> and upon that account we find <hi>Egypt</hi> often mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and the ſore Bondage and Perſecutions of the Church reckoned from thence, and in regard the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and State, with their City and Temple, were totally ruined, and themſelves captivated by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>Babylon,</hi> their conſtant and avowed Enemy, therefore the grand Enemy of Chriſt and the Goſpel, the Antichriſtian State, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: <hi>Babylon,</hi> and perhaps the Perſecutions and Deſolations of <hi>Antiochus</hi> are repreſented by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> when Satan ſhall be let looſe.</p>
            <p>This Eccleſiaſtical Structure is alſo in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtiled Antichriſtian, and the Monarchy of it Antichriſt, and that not only for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral oppoſition it makes, and the tendency it has againſt Chriſt and his Intereſt, but for this peculiar reaſon, becauſe there is a Vice Head, and a Vice Chriſt, and ſo a Falſe Chriſt ſet up in the Church; Chriſt's Place is by this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59586:30"/>notoriouſly uſurped, it being enthroned by its Head, the Man of Sin, in the Temple of God, as God, and moſt impiouſly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently perſonating Chriſt in all his mediatory Authority.</p>
            <p>Satan and the reſt of his Aſſociates, having thus from the beginning declared their enmity to God, and peculiarly to the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the Intereſt and Kingdom of Chriſt as Mediator, and purſued it in all Ages with the greateſt Rage and Malice imaginable, and having in the Antichriſtian Reign for 1260 Years, which began at the fall of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; [for the Beaſt and the ten Kings, which are the ſhivers of that Empire, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid to take their Power in one hour] and St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, he that does let will let, till he be taken out of the way; which is to tell us in other words, that till the Temporal Monarchy of <hi>Rome</hi> fell, the Spiritual Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy could not be erected, I ſay, having brought their Apoſtate Practices and Principles to the utmoſt culmen and heighth they could arrive at, they will then grow ripe for deſtruction, the Judge will appear to ſtand at the door, Chriſt will bring theſe lapſed Angels and their Aſſociates to their final doom, and deſtroy them and all their contrivances <hi>by the ſpirit of his mouth and the brightneſs of his coming,</hi> he will at laſt come to judgment with all his Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and according to that ancient Propheſie of <hi>Enoch,</hi> with all his Saints, he will come firſt in his Father's glory, to manifeſt before all, that he and the Father are one, and that the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59586:30"/>eſſential glory of God is his. 2dly, In his own glory, the glory of his mediatory Kingdom, having by his Humiliation, Suffering, Death and Reſurrection, conquered the Grave, Death, Hell, Sin and all the Effects of it, and acquited a peculiar glory to himſelf thereby: And, 3dly, In the glory of the Angels, who are all his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, not only in the glory they received from him in their firſt creation, but the glory they have acquired through him in keeping their firſt ſtate, and the glory of all their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervice and conformity to him and his Kingdom to the end: and this honor will all the Saints then have, not only to appear with him in glory, but to ſit in judgment with him, as his myſtical body, and as part of the reward of their works that follow them, and joyn in the Sentence pronounced by him.</p>
            <p>The firſt Sentence he pronounceth will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be upon theſe apoſtate Spirits, who were the firſt created Rebels, and them he will doom to eternal darkneſs and miſery; and ſo theſe Angels that could not content themſelves with the glory they had in their firſt creation from the ſecond Perſon as God, come to be fatally ſentenced by him for their aſpiring Impieties as he is Man; as they were made by him, ſo were they made for him, to come under his mediatory Authority, and be finally diſpoſed by him, and with this tormenting aggravation, that he is accompanied and glorified therein by the bleſſed Angels, whoſe company they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook, and in oppoſition to whom they have all along carried on a diſtinct intereſt, and by all
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59586:31"/>the Saints, the whole body of the Church, which they have ſo malign'd and perſecuted ſince the World began.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So let all thine Enemies periſh, O Lord;</hi> then will it be ſaid, the Myſtery of God is finiſhed, the Spirits Influences compleated, the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Kingdom perfected and delivered up, the Wicked are gone to their own place, the Saints are all come ſafe home to their Father's Houſe, and reſt for ever: <hi>God is all in all: Amen, Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the other part of the Angels, thoſe that kept their firſt ſtate, of whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes ſuch honourable mention, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to call them Morning ſtars, ſometimes Sons of God, Angels of Light, Chariots of God, his Hoaſts, his Miniſters, the Elect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; who with reſpect to their Nature are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Spirits; with reſpect to their Dignity, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, and Powers; and with reſpect to their Office and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Angels and miniſtring Spirits; [for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel is a word relates to their Employment and not to their Nature,] and we find Men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Scripture by vertue of their Offices and Employments called Angels. In the order of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogues, there was one that chiefly prayed for the People and bleſſed them, and him they called the Angel of the Synagogue; and that I believe St. <hi>John</hi> relates to when he writes to the Angels of the ſeven Churches; how theſe, I ſay, were deſigned in a particular manner to all their future uſe, ſervice and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in their creation at the firſt by the ſecond
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59586:31"/>Perſon in the Trinity, will very manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider, firſt, the dependance they have upon him, and, ſecondly, their ſubjection and ſerviceableneſs unto him. Firſt, Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him: The Scripture informs us, that after the diſorder and ſcattered, confuſed, miſerable ſtate of things, that Sin had introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and occaſioned, God was pleaſed to reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate and gather all together into one head, according to St. <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 1.10. <hi>That he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are one arth even in him:</hi> and erect an unalterable Kingdom wherein his Soul ſhould reſt, under the rule of the ſecond perſon incarnate, with a diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeveral effects of his Government ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Divine Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Goodneſs, as the ſtate of the World then ſtood; [for it was of old eminently foretold of him, that the Scepter of his Kingdom ſhould be a right Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter] wicked Angels, and Men obſtinately and finally impenitent and wicked, were to remain enchain'd by his power, until he pronounced their laſt Sentence; the elect Angels were to come under his Headſhip and Rule, [he being their Head though he be not their Redeemer, and their Security though not their Satisfaction] and be ſecured thereby againſt all created dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of relapſing, and embodied with all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved amongſt Men, as Subjects of one intire Kingdom under the ſame Monarch and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>
            <p>And thus it pleaſed God, that neither the happineſs of Angels nor Men ſhould be fixed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59586:32"/>or perfected by his creating Power, exerted by the ſecond Perſon at the firſt, but by his reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, recovering, eſtabliſhing Power, exerted in the ſame perſon becoming Man, and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all the Laws of that mediatory Kingdom God deſigned [for the praiſe of his Grace and Glory] to erect in and by him.</p>
            <p>So that we ſee the eternal deſign of creating theſe Angels, by the ſecond perſon was, that firſt they might come under his Headſhip, and be ſecured in all their created glory by him in that future ſtate of Mediatorſhip he was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto: and ſecondly, that they might be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial and ſerviceable to all the ends of his Kingdom and Government, wherein as the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> v. 20. <hi>By the blood of his croſs</hi> all things in Heaven and Earth are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, and alſo things in Heaven, and things on Earth one to another, or elſe 'twere not to be thought that the Angels, who remain ſpotleſs and untainted of ſin, ſhould ever enter into any converſe with ſuch a defiled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate creature as Man, much leſs to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a Miniſtry and Service on his behalf, whereas now, by vertue of that Reconciliation, by the Blood of his Croſs, their great delight is in the Miniſtry of Reconciliation, and to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Spirits on their behalf who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation.</p>
            <p>Two wonderful things by Chriſt's aſſumption of the Humane Nature, and by the Blood of his Croſs are brought to paſs: 1st, That the Angels, the more noble Creatures, and who never fell under the leaſt ſtain of any guilt,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59586:32"/>ſhould become Servants to poor miſerable apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Man. 2dly, That the Eſtabliſhment and Security of all the created angelical Glory, ſhould depend upon that Aſſumption and Chriſt ſo circumſtanced, for he took not on him the Nature of Angels, but in the Nature of a much more inferior Creature, became their Security, their Soveraign and Head, and by this glorious contrivance of the bleſſed God, Man upon Earth is ſet upon his legs and recovered, the Tabernacle of <hi>Adam</hi> that was fallen is raiſed up again, and the Angels that kept their firſt ſtate are ſecured in ever ſo doing, it having pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwell, and that every part of the Creation, ſhould ſome way or other owe their happineſs to him, and that upon the trueſt reaſon, to him every Knee ſhould bow, both of things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and things on Earth, even to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we take a diſtinct conſideration of Man, the nobleſt part of this lower World, and the Lord of it, we ſhall ſoon diſcover, that all the future deſigns of God, relating to him, were laid in his creation of him at the firſt, by the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, and this will appear ſeveral ways:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Man we know was originally made in ſuch a ſtate as laſted but a while, <hi>Man created in Honour abode not,</hi> that innate freedom of choice he was made withal with reference to good or evil, [which was the bottom <hi>Adam</hi> firſt ſtood upon] God well knew and foreſaw, would not ſecure him long, but would ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and the tendency of Man's free choice
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59586:33"/>would be ever <hi>in partem deteriorem;</hi> yet ſo it pleaſed God to make him, and not in the firſt ſtate to ſecure him, becauſe his deſigns lay quite otherways; [and who ſhall councel infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?] the Scenes of this World, as now it is, were all before him, he intended Man for a ſecond Creation, from whence ſhould ariſe the Glory he deſigned to himſelf by him and from him, and Man's Happineſs and Reſt for ever, and both theſe Creations were to be performed by the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity; and therefore ſo ſoon as Man fell, and diſcovered the impotency of that firſt ſtate, God declares his recovery in the ſecond Perſon, and puts forth his hand and lifts him up to a better, upon which never any blot nor ſtain ſhould come, in which both the Soul of God and Man ſhould reſt for ever, and this by that gracious, yet withal then myſterious Promiſe, <hi>That the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the ſerpents head;</hi> by which Promiſe, the foundation of all Mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and future happineſs is laid in the ſecond Perſon, deſigned for the Aſſumption of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; ſo that it evidently appears, that when God made Man by the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in a ſtate that was not to endure, his deſign was to recover and remake him by the ſame bleſſed Perſon in that nature he had ſo made; God at the firſt made Man by the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Image of God, and that being loſt, brings forth the ſecond Perſon in the Image of Man, and therein Man is recovered and ſaved, for he was made in the likeneſs of Men, and found in faſhion of a Man, ſo that the union of the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59586:33"/>in the ſecond Perſon, is the great Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone upon which the welfare and happineſs of all created Beings, and moſt eminently and particularly of Man's, is built up and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This will appear from the mighty and ſtupendious Undertakings of the ſecond Perſon incarnate on the behalf of Mankind, He it is that by his own Arm brings Salvation, and ſingly undergoes the Burden and Weight of all Humane Miſeries and Misfortunes, the care of all the concerns that belong to Mankind are laid upon him, and the recovery of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Poſterity of apoſtate <hi>Adam</hi> is ſolely left to his Undertaking, Conduct and Manage, ever ſince that firſt Promiſe concerning him, ſet forth by the Seed of the Woman, Mankind has been his Care, and the Church his peculiar Province; the Faith of all the Holy Men in the firſt times was built upon his promiſed and intended coming: It was propheſied of him in the 72 <hi>Pſalm, Prayer alſo ſhall be made for him continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> that is, for his coming and incarnation before he did come, and for the ſucceſs of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his ſecond coming after he was come: It is he that hath been with the Church in all Ages, and appeared ſo often to the Fathers in the Patriarchal times in humane ſhape, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their Faith, and aſſure his future Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when the fulneſs of time for his being born of a Woman and born under the Law [that is, ſtanding in Man's ſteed and obliged to the mediatory righteouſneſs God required from him] came, the whole courſe of his Life, his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59586:34"/>Sufferings, Death and Reſurrection, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion above, are all on the Churches ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to make a full and ample proviſion for all the Declenſions and Apoſtaſies of Humane Nature, and ſecure Man's Eternal Happineſs with himſelf for ever; ſo that 'tis evident, that God's making the World at firſt by the ſecond Perſon, was in order to the diſcovery of his manifold Wiſdom and infinite Grace, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming and recovering it by the ſame bleſſed Perſon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This will appear from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the whole Dominion and Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over Mankind, the intire diſpoſal of Man, is committed unto him, how correſpondent is it to all God's revealed purpoſes, touching his own Glory, and Man's Happineſs, that a mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Dominion ſhould be veſted in the ſecond Perſon, that the creating and redeeming Right over Man ſhould all concenter in him; ſometimes we are in Scripture told of his creating Right: ſo in the firſt of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, <hi>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not:</hi> ſometimes we are told of his Right by Redemption, <hi>The Father</hi> [ſo he himſelf tells us] <hi>judgeth no man, but hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all judgment to the Son:</hi> and the reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for it is, becauſe he is the Son of Man, the true Seed of the Woman, and the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and Man, and upon that account 'tis ſaid he will judge the World <hi>by that man whom he hath appointed;</hi> the ordering, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, and final diſpoſal of Man, belongs alone to this bleſſed Perſon, he that made us
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59586:34"/>and knew our original frame, he alone could beſt tell how to recover and remake us, and from everlaſting 'twas God's pleaſure it ſhould be ſo: In his Redemption all is taken care for, all is recover'd and fetch'd back, not a Hoof of what was made and loſt is left behind, there is a Plaiſter provided for every Sore, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for every Malady, an infinite Treaſury of Grace provided and ſuted to all depraved hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faculties, to unite Man again to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and Redeemer, <hi>with cords of love and bands of a man,</hi> to influence the whole Soul of Man, to convince his Underſtanding, and govern him in a way of true Wiſdom and Knowledge, to ſeize his Affections with the moſt heart-affecting Motives and moſt glorious Objects, and to fix the unruly Will in a right Path, out of which it ſhould never again wander: All the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſince <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall of the Souls of Men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and the Influences of God and his Spirit upon them, they are all tranſacted, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, and will be finally judged of by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon; this is the Kingdom of God, and the great Realm of Chriſt within Men, not a Divine Whiſper into any Man's Breaſt by the Holy Ghoſt, but 'tis from the Mediator, and a conſequent of his Ordination and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the great Effect of Chriſt's aſcending Conqueror into Heaven, was the ſending down the Holy Ghoſt, and till he did ſo the Holy Ghoſt could not in that glorious eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner appear as afterwards he did, for he came from Heaven with the Ratification of that Peace and Reconciliation that Chriſt had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59586:35"/>this we are poſitively told in the 7th of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, <hi>The Holy Ghost was not yet given, becauſe Christ was not yet glorified.</hi> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be an eternal determination by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, that till the mediatory Work was all compleated, and Chriſt was aſcended and had made his triumphant appearance in Heaven as a Conqueror, the Holy Ghoſt ſhould not be ſent down; and therefore our Saviour tells his Diſciples plainly, <hi>Unleſs I go away the comforter cannot come, and it is expedient for you,</hi> upon that account, <hi>that I do go away, for if I go I will ſend him unto you:</hi> this is the grand effect of Chriſt's aſcention, to procure the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, that great Engine of Salvation, the Sword of the Lord in Chriſt's hand, the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Operator by which the Mediator erects his Kingdom, and without whoſe Influences upon the Souls of Men, to change and remark them, no Laws of Grace, no Terms of Salvation, though never ſo eaſie, would ever have proved effectual for Man's Recovery and Happineſs; this is the great effect of what Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for the World, for Men to receive an ability from Heaven to believe and obey what God requires of us; had not this been, the Conditions of the Goſpel would have been as little performed as thoſe of the Law: this ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Holy Ghoſt from Heaven, St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> tells us, the Angels deſire to look into, 'tis an Alluſion unto the Cher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bims, that were made with their Faces looking upon the Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat, to let us know, that the Angels above di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently behold the glorious effects of God's
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59586:35"/>Grace to this lower World; and two ſights they have had by their attentiveneſs thereon, which were both ſtupendious and wonderful; Firſt, The ſecond Perſon leaving Heaven, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending upon Earth, becoming Man, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his abode for a time here; And, ſecondly, Upon his return, ſo ſoon as the ſecond Perſon aſcended, the Holy Ghoſt coming down to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage all the concerns Chriſt left behind him here below.</p>
            <p>And as all the Operations of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Spirits of Men, are under the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Conduct, ſo the Behaviour of all Men is noted in his Book, and laid up in his Records, in order to a future Judgment: which Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of everlaſting duration, for after he has given up the Kingdom to the Father, both the Righteous and the Wicked will for ever remain in the ſame poſture and condition his Judgment left them, the Wicked will be for ever miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, by vertue of his Sentence, and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous enjoy their everlaſting portion of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from his adjudging them thereunto; ſo that he is to all Men, their <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> in Creation, in Redemption, in Superiority and Government, and in that final, irreverſible and eternal Judgment he will at laſt paſs upon them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This important Truth is evident from hence, The ſupreme End of all God's Works is his Glory: now 'tis plain, that the glory God deſigned to himſelf, by the making and forming of Man, 'tis all given up and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, in, by, and through the Son; upon
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59586:36"/>that account, he that honours the Son honours the Father, the creating Work of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, his redeeming Work, his mediatory Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, all his Workings and Operations by the Holy Ghoſt upon the Hearts and Spirits of Men, and his final Judgment at laſt, they are but to collect and bring in a Revenue of Glory for the Father, and when the Kingdom is delivered up to the Father, all the Glory of it will for ever center in him.</p>
            <p>This will farther appear the larger View we take of the Particulars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, In the Creation of Man by the ſecond Perſon, how greatly does the glory of God's Power manifeſt it ſelf, in bringing into being ſuch a creature as Man firſt was, ſo ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly conſtituted, and ever after ſo fearfully and wonderfully propagated, compounded part of Heaven and part of Earth, between an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel above, and a Beaſt that periſheth below, a ſpark of Divinity and Eternity, put into a lump of mouldering Clay, intended to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated after a dreadful manner, and as wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to meet again and be reunited; ſuch is the Soul breathed into the Body, a Creature made able ſtill to mount upwards, be guided by his nobler part, and cleave to his Maker as his chief good, and alſo under poſſibility of being influenced by his meaner and lower part, and ſtill ſinking down into vanity, ſenſuality and folly; a Creature ſo made, as to be of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duration, and a future Subject of mighty Rewards and Puniſhments; and his Perſon, by reaſon of the wonderful and unbounded work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59586:36"/>of his Soul, a Stage of ſtupendious Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, wherein the whole Trinity are moſt eminently manifeſted, all the Angels both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and below moſt highly concern'd, and in which the welfare of all the reſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and of this lower part of the World is much bound up; this Creature although he may derive himſelf from the eternal pleaſure of all the Perſons in the Godhead, yet his Creation was the peculiar Act and Operation of the ſecond Perſons, and the Glory of that Creation reſults to the Deity through him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Glory of God's innate Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Goodneſs, is exceeding tranſparent from hence; no ſooner had Man loſt himſelf but the flood-gates of Divine Bounty are let open by the undertakings of the Son; nothing imaginable, nothing poſſible, could ſo diſplay Divine Grace, as Chriſt's undertaking to leave Heaven and become Man, and do what he did for Man's ſake; no Glaſs but this, could have ſhew'd at once, the compleat and intire Glory of that Attribute, the Faculties of Angels and Men, though they are large and inquiſitive, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive and ſagacious, yet they are quite ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd and extaſiz'd by this Tranſaction, the Object quite over-matching the Faculty; when God gives his Son and himſelf in him, what Creature can think himſelf into the Heighths and Depths of that Gift, or pretend to ſpan its Dimenſions in his Imagination? all we can ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon this Subject is what St. <hi>Paul</hi> [in a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Extaſie] ſays in the 8th of the <hi>Romans, What ſhall we ſay to theſe things?</hi> and improve
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59586:37"/>it as he does there, by that holy Interrogation, <hi>He that has given us his Son, will he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, How tranſparent is the Glory of God's Juſtice, in puniſhing Sin upon his own Son, and redeeming the World by no leſs a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice than the Blood of God; this is to exalt the Glory of that Attribute to its utmoſt heighth, and for ever to abaſe Man, and lay him as low as he can be: this is a ſtupendious Inſtruction to the prophane ignorant World, to let them ſee what Sin is, and what the ſenſe is God has of it, and how hard a thing it is for a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious creature to be reconciled again unto God, when we conſider the abſolute boundleſs Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Soveraignty God has over us, as our Maker, and the uncontroulable Authority that is inherent and reſides in that infinite Being, that gives being to all beſides himſelf, and whoſe Laws are in their nature perfect, and the very quinteſſence of all rectitude, we muſt needs then reflect upon that rebellious Evil and Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is in Sin, no contradiction can conſiſt with ſuch a Being as God is, and therefore no Man can oppoſe him and proſper: whil'ſt Man abides in a ſtate of ſubjection and conformity to him, he is happy, and nothing can make him miſerable, but when he turns aſide to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and the Madneſs and Folly of Sin, he becomes naked, a dread and terror, a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ghoſt to himſelf, and renders himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to all the Misfortunes and Miſeries his Being is capable of.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59586:37"/>
            <p>Fourthly, By the ſecond Perſon is given up unto God the glory of his rectoral and magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratical Authority over all his Creatures, and therefore in the ſecond <hi>Pſalm</hi> God calls him, his King, being both from him, and for him; this is done by Chriſt's Rule and Government, as Head of the Church, the whole Creation is put into ſubjection to him, and he that is in our own nature our Redeemer and Saviour, him has God made to be Ruler and Lord of all: By his Government all the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are clearly and evidently diſplay'd, all the righteous Methods of Government purſu'd, and all the true and noble Ends of it brought about and accompliſhed. All the various Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Windings of Humane Affairs here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as they are under the Mediator's regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are but ſubſervient to a diſcovery and manifeſtation of God's Wiſdom, his Power, his Grace, and other Divine Attributes, and through them all, perfect Methods are purſu'd, and at laſt the right Ends will be attained, giving every Man according to his Works, and ſetling Rewards and Puniſhments in their due places.</p>
            <p>In two reſpects the Excellency of Chriſt's Government does chiefly appear: 1st, In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the World, as he is King of Nations; And, 2dly, In reſpect of the Church, as he is King of Saints.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the World, the Glory of Chriſt's Government appears eminent in theſe four things:</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59586:38"/>
            <p n="1">1. In his providential Endeavours in the courſe and motion of Humane Affairs, for their Information, Reformation, and Salvation, bringing Men out of Satan's Kingdom, and embodying them with his Church, over-ruling things in the courſe of the World to tend that way, his Heart is ſtill upon Salvation, and his ultimate deſign to make Men eternally happy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In reſpect of thoſe ſpiritual inviſible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and Convictions by which he more nearly treats with the World about their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Welfare, and all the Long-ſuffering he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By his mighty over-ruling all the violent and raging Oppoſitions made by the World and the Powers thereof, againſt Him, his Church, and his Intereſt, and doing it in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that whatever is moſt maliciouſly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them, ſhall be rendred uſeful and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By his compleat Conqueſt over and final Judgment upon all his incorrigible Enemies at laſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, With reſpect to the Church, there he is moſt eminently triumphant in his Glory and Government, for he dwelleth in Heaven, and ruleth on Earth, but reigneth in <hi>Sion;</hi> the Church is his peculiar Province, where he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays the manifold Wiſdom of God in curious variety:</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are all redeemed with his own Blood; St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>We are not redeemed with corruptible things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They bear his Image; look upon the Frame and Conſtitution of every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59586:38"/>and if you ask whoſe Image and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is this, the anſwer is, it is Chriſt's; and therefore the ſame treatment he met with here below, the very ſame will always attend the Church; every Chriſtian is a Member of the New Creation, Chriſt has remade him all over; herein lyes the great Power and Glory of Chriſt's Kingdom, in remaking and new making of the Sons of Men, and this New Creation, 'tis an Abomination to the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and all apoſtate and unrecovered Men, and ſo will be to the end of the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The tender Heart and gracious Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt is moſt tranſparently beheld in the Government of his Church, of his own Houſe and Family; 'tis here you may have the report of all his unwearied Kindneſs, and unutterable Forgiveneſs, of all his Attendance upon, and Endurance of, the froward and perverſe Spirits of Men; here you may ſee all the fulfilling of the good pleaſure of his Goodneſs, and the work of Faith with power, and all thoſe gentle, eaſie and obliging Methods he uſeth to gain Souls to himſelf and render them happy, how many Faults he bears with and forgives in his People, how many Temptations he ſhields them from, and how many ſore Lapſes he pities them in, and recovers them from under, and puts forth his Hand, as he did to <hi>Peter,</hi> to every ſinking Soul: what that eminent Apoſtle and Servant of Chriſt ſaid of himſelf, is much more verified in his great Maſter and ours; upon him lyes continually the care of all the Churches, and of every particular Member, and that not only

            <p>Laftly, The Greatneſs and Excellency of this Government appears herein, that he makes all ſubſervient unto it, and brings all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſafely to their Eternal Inheritance; all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Motions are ſo over-ruled, as to promote the great Work of Salvation; as all things were deſigned in their firſt make, to be ſerviceable to the manifeſtation of Divine Grace therein, ſo they are made to be in the future Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all Ages: how glorious and wonderful an Encloſure is the Church out of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane apoſtate World? God the Father is the Supreme Benefactor, ſets the great Wheel going, <hi>For the Son does nothing but what he ſees the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do:</hi> And in the great Volume of God's Book, this peculiar <hi>Memorandum</hi> is made, and 'tis recorded of him, that he came to do the Father's Will; <hi>I come to do thy will, O God.</hi> All that Chriſt does is but the Execution of the Father's deſigns; the Holy Ghoſt is their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Comforter and Companion, the grand O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator in Chriſt's Kingdom, and that mighty Inſtrument by which all is effected, that heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing, life-reforming, wonder-working Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by which all the ſtubborn, unruly, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable Luſts of Men, all the Wills of the Fleſh and of the Mind are all ſubdued, Leopards Spots quite waſhed away, <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Skins made white, and Men old in ſinning, and ſuch as are accuſtomed to do evil, are ſo inſtructed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and changed, that they readily learn to do well, reſign up themſelves as Temples for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59586:39"/>that bleſſed Spirit to dwell in, and are no more led by depraved, unruly Appetites, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conducted and managed by that ſafe and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Adviſer.</p>
            <p>Here's the great delight of God, in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſtored, in Man new made, and remade, by the mighty workings of the Holy Ghoſt in the Mediator's hand's; God ſays of theſe Men, <hi>the world is not worthy of them;</hi> but the World are quite of another opinion, for they cry out, <hi>Away with ſuch fellows from the earth, it is not fit they ſhould live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, As it appears that the whole deſign of God, touching both Angels and Men, was laid in his firſt creation of them by the Son, ſo is it in reference to all the reſt of the Creation: the inferior Creatures were ſo made as that God would receive all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of them from Man, they were made for his uſe and put in ſubjection to him; Man's Habitation is this lower World, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the Furniture of it given to him of God; and as the Dominion and Soveraignty of this inferior part of the World was veſted in Man, by an unalterable Law of Creation, ſo it has ever ſince been involved in his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while Man abode in his primitive ſtate, all the reſt of the Creatures kept their original luſtre and beauty: In Man's fall, they alſo fell; when Man fell into Rebellion, this lower World fell under a Curſe for his ſake, and that Curſe is gradually taken off from the Creatures as Man is renewed and reſtored by that gracious Covenant of God ſealed in the Blood of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59586:40"/>Mediator; ſo at laſt when the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, the whole Creation ſhall be reſtored to its original and firſt created Glory.</p>
            <p>The Scripture gives plain evidence to both theſe things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Curſe is gradually taken off from the Creatures as Man is reſtored and the Church built up: but 'tis in this ſenſe to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and no farther, that the Curſe is taken off from the Creatures. As to Man's uſe and enjoyment of them, the Curſe upon them lay in two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1st, A natural defacing of them, and degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them from their original Image; for at firſt every thing was very good and there was no deformity nor any ſuch production as Briers and Thorns:</p>
            <p>And, 2dly, By inverting the uſe they were created for, [which was to be a Bleſſing] and laying the enjoyment of them by Man under a Curſe and a Judgment for Sin's ſake.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of the firſt, The Creatures conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue alike to all, and will do ſo till the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things; the Creatures are naturally the ſame to good and bad, and enjoyed by both alike, without any ſuch diſtinction or change.</p>
            <p>But as to their enjoyment and uſe the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is plain; As Man is by the Mediator reconciled unto God, ſo he comes to a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied enjoyment of and right to all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for God in the gift of his Son, has with him alſo freely (by a ſecond Donation) given us all ſuch things: and ſo the Creatures are
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59586:40"/>now enjoyed not by vertue of Man's firſt right to them in Creation, but by vertue of Chriſt's Purchaſe and Redemption: St. <hi>Paul</hi> ranks things in this order, <hi>All things are yours,</hi> [ſpeaking to the Saints] <hi>and you are Chriſt's, and Christ is God's.</hi> To a Believer every Creature is good, not as it was originally ſo made, but as it is by Chriſt reſtored into that condition, the Curſe removed, and as it is ſanctified by the Word of God and Prayer; to a Man unrenewed and unreconciled to God in the Mediator, God's original Curſe upon the Creatures ſtill remains, and he enjoys them with that doleful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, That his Table is a Snare; and upon that account the Holy Ghoſt tells us, <hi>That a little that a righteous man has, is better than the great riches of the wicked, and that to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> lays it down as an undoubted Maxim, <hi>That the curſe of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked:</hi> where-ever <hi>Adam</hi>'s original Rebellion is upheld and promoted, there the primitive Curſe then pronounced upon the Creatures remains; 'tis only removed by Chriſt, to thoſe that have intereſt in him, and are reconciled to God by him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As the Curſe upon the Creatures is in all Ages gradually taken off, as to their uſe and enjoyment, to ſuch as believe and obey the Goſpel, ſo by vertue of the Price Chriſt has paid, and the reſtoring recovering Power put into his Hand thereupon, the whole Creation at laſt, ſhall be reſcued from the Slavery and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity it has lain under, and be reſtored to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59586:41"/>its primitive Beauty and Excellency; we may ſay in this caſe as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of Death, <hi>For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, for as in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive:</hi> As the Creatures fell and died as it were with Man, ſo ſhall they be reſtored, and have a reſurrection in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; their Reſtoration is one part of Chriſt's Purchaſe; as they were curſed for <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſake, ſo they ſhall be again revived and bleſſed for Chriſt's ſake; who can imagine that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall always groan under Bondage to the Luſts, Paſſions and Debaucheries of Men, and not at laſt put on again its beautiful Garments, and in a right and due manner be ſerviceable to that end [which was the uſe and delight of Man while he lived in communion with his God] for which it was originally made? This Reſtoration will be accompliſhed at Chriſt's ſecond coming, for then will be the great Jubile the Creation has ſo long groaned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>Many Paſſages there are in Scripture that give in Evidence to this Truth, but I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the Proof of it only from three Texts; the firſt of which, as to the proof of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is very probable, the other two very poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; the firſt is in the 65th of <hi>Eſau, The wolf and the lamb ſhall feed together, and the lion ſhall eat ſtraw like the bullock, and dust ſhall be the ſerpents meat, they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy mountain, ſaith the Lord.</hi> This ſeems to me a plain Propheſie of the Deliverance and Reſtoration of the Creatures: When the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59586:41"/>Order of Creation was loſt, as Man fell into Rebellion againſt God, ſo the Creatures fell into Rebellion againſt him, and into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enmity one againſt another. This ſeems to be a Propheſie of the Creatures reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and of their reconciliation towards Man, and towards each other: Some take it for a metaphorical Deſcription of the future Effects of the Goſpel upon the Spirits of wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial and unreaſonable Men, and that Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and Harmony the Goſpel ſhould produce amongſt Mankind: But I conceive this Text is literally to be underſtood, and cannot be fairly ſo taken, for divers conſiderable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1st, Becauſe the time to which this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie relates, and in which it is to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd, is when there ſhall be a new Heavens and a new Earth; and what more proper to conceive, than that when the Heavens and Earth are to be new, the Creatures ſhould have new Qualities and Conditions? It is plain ſo to be, if you look back to the 17th Verſe, and read on to this, <hi>For behold I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred nor come into mind:</hi> And from thence, to the 25th and laſt Verſe, is a perfect De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the State of this new Heaven and new Earth, and the happy condition the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be reſtored unto: This new Heaven and new Earth is to be at Chriſt's ſecond co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, when the reſtitution of all things is to be; for the new Heavens and new Earth, and the reſtitution of all things in Scripture-phraſe, are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59586:42"/>the ſame; and what time ſo likely, ſo fit, and proper for this to be effected as then? and 'tis certain it muſt be then or never. The other Propheſie of this Matter in the 11th Chapter of this Propheſie in theſe words: <hi>The wolf alſo ſhall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard ſhall lye down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little child ſhall lead them, and the cow and the bear ſhall feed, their young ones ſhall lye down together, and the lion ſhall eat ſtraw like the ox, and the ſucking child ſhall play upon the hole of the aſp,</hi> is to be when <hi>knowledge ſhall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the earth as the waters cover the ſea;</hi> which is but an expreſſion of the ſame time before mentioned in other words, it ſhall be when Chriſt ſhall come and ſhall ſet all to rights.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, It ſeems more reaſonable, to take this Text literally than metaphorically, [allowing for the Rhetorick of the prophetick Stile] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe oppoſite Creatures are ſaid to lye down and quietly cohabit one with another, retaining their own diſtinct and proper Natures ſtill; though a Lion lye down with a Lamb, yet he is a Lion ſtill; the very life of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie lyes in that, that a Lion whil'ſt a Lion ſhall lye down with the Lamb, the creature is the ſame, only the hurtful enmity removed. Now, ſhould we take it metaphorically, the Goſpel-change is rather to make a Lion a Lamb, to alter the very Nature and Diſpoſition, and to infuſe new Habits and Qualities, and ſo a Lamb would lye down with a Lamb, and not a Lion or a Wolf with a Lamb, if we take it in ſtrict ſence; and then what is intended
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59586:42"/>to ſignifie, would not well agree to what is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Some Parts and Paſſages of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies cannot fairly be conſtrued in any ſuch metaphorical ſenſe, as that the Lion ſhall eat Straw like the Ox, and Duſt ſhall be the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents Food, by which the removal of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures enmity one to another, and their devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one another as an effect thereof, ſeems to be ſingly and literally ſignified, and an account given how they ſhall live in that ſtate, when all theſe hurtful qualities introduced by Man's ſin at the firſt ſhall be removed; 't will be hard, with any tolerable and ſober ſenſe, to put a myſtical and metaphorical meaning upon theſe Paſſages, and thoſe that have attempted it have much juſtified the literal interpretation by their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune in the attempt, and if it ſeem neceſſary to take any part of the Propheſie literally, it will be a probable ground to ſuppoſe the whole ought ſo to be taken: and the truth is, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets do ſeem often plainly to foretel, that the Creatures ſhall be all reconciled to each other, and brought into their due and primitive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto Man, according to that Paſſage in the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, In that day will I make a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for them with the beaſts of the field, and with the fowls of the heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground;</hi> that is, as I take it, they ſhall be reſtored and reduced to that order they were firſt made in, and a metaphorical ſenſe put upon this Propheſie, would ſeem very he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox and foreign, to what by the Context the Prophet ſeems to intend and aim at. The
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59586:43"/>ſecond Scripture I ſhall inſiſt on, is that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 8th of the <hi>Romans</hi> v. 21. <hi>Becauſe the creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God, for we know that the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now:</hi> this is highly probable to be one of thoſe Diſcourſes of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which St. <hi>Peter</hi> mentions, <hi>in which there are ſome things hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood;</hi> for St. <hi>Peter,</hi> where he quotes St. <hi>Paul</hi> for his writing in his Epiſtles of thoſe things, is there ſpeaking of the new Heavens and new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs, the Seaſon when the Creatures reſtoration is to be. There are many things hard to be underſtood in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and without all doubt, many, very many things within its bowels that lye undiſcovered and untaken notice of as yet; for 'tis a Book intended for the inſtruction of the Church, and to exerciſe her care and induſtry in all Ages; it will be with the Church in the laſt period of the World, as it was with the Diſciples when they went to <hi>Emaus,</hi> Chriſt will open their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and give them a clear view of the Scriptures, and of all things therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, touching himſelf, and the glory of his Kingdom, and the reſtitution of all things. For the clear underſtanding of this Text in hand, it will be neceſſary to take in the Context from the 18th Verſe, <hi>For I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us, for the earneſt expectation of the creature waiteth for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Sons of God:</hi> the laſt part of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59586:43"/>18th Verſe is that (as I think) from which the Apoſtle takes the riſe of his whole Diſcourſe in theſe Verſes, <hi>[are not worthy to be compared to the glory that ſhall be revealed in us,]</hi> and proceeds in the 19th Verſe to ſhew, there will be ſuch a glory; for the whole Creation expects it, their deliverance being to be contemporary with it, <hi>For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifeſtations of the Sons of God:</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeemeth to be, that he ſpeaketh not of the glory of Heaven in the 18th Verſe, but of that glory that ſhall be revealed in the Saints here in this World before the concluſion of it, when the whole World ſhall become the Kingdom of Chriſt and his Saints; and ſo the force of the compariſon lyes the ſtronger, the ſufferings that we have in this World, are not worthy to be compared to the glory that ſhall be revealed in us even in this World; and then in Verſe 19, proceeds to ſhew there ſhall be ſuch a glory, <hi>For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God;</hi> that is, there is an expectancy in the whole Creation of ſuch a day: when the Sons of God are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted and revealed in the glory that is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, then the whole Creation ſhall enjoy a Reſtoration and Jubile. 'Tis of great moment here to take notice, that the Apoſtles Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis is not between the Sons of God, and the Sons of Men, of any ſort, but between the Sons of God and the Creature; by which is certainly meant the inanimate part of the World, which is ſaid in its way to expect; for nothing is more common in Scripture, than to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59586:44"/>apply rational Acts to irrational Creatures, as calling upon the Heavens and the Earth to hear, and many ſuch like: <hi>For the creature,</hi> Verſe 20. <hi>was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope:</hi> that is, the whole Creation was curſed and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to vanity, by the juſt judgment of God for Man's ſin, but yet ſo that it remains in hope; and why? becauſe in Verſe 21. the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the Children of God, becauſe there is a reſtoration belongs to it, and the oppoſition is ſtill between the Sons of God and the Creature, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any tolerable ſenſe be made between Man and Man.</p>
            <p>The ſcope of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this place ſeems clearly to be this, That the Creature being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a curſe, and under a preternatural ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and uſage, not ſuitable to its firſt make and deſignment, by reaſon of Man's ſin, and being unwillingly ſubjected thereunto, did in its way diſlike it, groan to be delivered from it, and naturally tended to its primitive ſtate and uſe, which it was to be reſtored unto, when the Sons of God ſhould be manifeſted, and Chriſt ſhould ſet up his glorious Kingdom here upon Earth. This Interpretation, though without doubt it contains the natural and genuine ſenſe of the Apoſtle, is by ſome contradicted, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the word [Creature] in another ſenſe; that is to ſay, by taking it to mean the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that part of the World who (ſay they) were unwillingly ſubjected by the Devil
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59586:44"/>to all the bondage of the Heatheniſh Worſhip and Religion, and groaned to be delivered from under it: Now both the Text it ſelf, and the Context, utterly refuſe this interpretation; For, firſt, we muſt repreſent the Apoſtle thus ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>For I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us, for the earneſt expectation of the Gentiles waiteth for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God.</hi> The Apoſtle does not make the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to lye between the Sons of God and the Sons of Men of any ſort, but between the Sons of God, and the irrational part of the World, and makes the groaning of that, after the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Sons of God, a reaſon why there ſhall be ſuch a manifeſtation; and in Verſe 20. when he ſays the Creature was made ſubject to Vanity, he points chiefly at the irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional part of the World, which was made ſo by God's curſe upon Man, and upon it for Man's ſake; but 'tis very improper to ſay the <hi>Gentile</hi> World was made ſubject to Vanity, [and underſtand, as they do, Vanity to be their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry] unwillingly, becauſe what they did in that, was voluntary, what they choſe, and what they highly applauded themſelves in, and to ſay the Devil had ſubjected them to their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in hope, [which thoſe that thus interpret do and muſt ſay] is plainly to ſay, the Devil ſubjected them to Idolatry, in order to a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance unto Salvation, which is abſurd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And in Verſe 21. the Apoſtle lays the Emphaſis ſo, as points clearly at the irrational and Ioweſt part of the World, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſays he,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59586:45"/>
               <hi>the creature it ſelf,</hi> he does not in the leaſt ſeem to intend Mankind or any ſort of them, but the loweſt and meaneſt part of the World, and that he muſt needs mean, by ſaying, <hi>the creature it ſelf,</hi> in the moſt diminutive ſenſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for 'tis evidently to diſtinguiſh, between the Creature, and the Sons of God, and not to make the Antitheſis between one ſort of Men and another: And in Verſe 22. he tells you, the whole Creation, or every Creature groaneth and travaileth in pain for deliverance; he tells you before, the Creature was in expectancy, and now he tells you, it groans and travaileth in pain; and this Creature is the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or every Creature: 'tis the very ſame word that is uſed all along this Context, and therefore 'tis the ſame thing he diſcourſeth of. Let any Man in theſe Verſes read the <hi>Gentile</hi> World, inſtead of the word Creature, and whole Creation, (or, as it is better to be rendred, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature) and then ſee, what an awkward ill-cohering ſenſe is impoſed upon the Apoſtle thereby.</p>
            <p>The third Scripture I ſhall inſiſt on, for the proof of this Point, ſeems more plain and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive than any, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21. <hi>Whom the heavens muſt receive, until the times of reſtitution of all things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets ſince the world began.</hi> This Text is part of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, the effect of which was ſo famous a converſion; his Point was to prove, that that ſame Jeſus whom they cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied was the true Meſſiah, that he was riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but not to be ſeen by them any more
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59586:45"/>upon Earth, which perhaps the <hi>Jews</hi> expected, to juſtifie the truth of his Reſurrection, and to render him in a capacity to be ſuch a temporal Meſſiah as they look'd for; this ſeems preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſpoken, to forbid any ſuch expectation, he tells them, the Heavens, whither he was aſcended, muſt contain him until the reſtitution of all things: What can be more plain, than that theſe two things reſult from this Text?</p>
            <p n="1">1st, That Chriſt will again appear in the end of the World, for the Heavens muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him, but until, that is, to a determinate time.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, That his appearing again, will be in thoſe times wherein all things ſhall be reſtored, whatever is defiled, defaced, diſordered, and miſplaced by ſin, ſhall be reduced in thoſe times to its primitive beauty and order, as a very particular effect of Chriſt's Redemption; and they are called times of reſtitution, becauſe they will precede and laſt ſome time before the day of Judgment, which is uſually expreſſed in Scripture ſingularly by one poſitive deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate day; the day of Judgment to all good Men, will be much more than a reſtitution, it will bring them to a far better ſtate than ever they were made in: but theſe are called times of reſtitution of all things, not only Men, but all the Creation ſhall partake of the benefits of theſe times; and theſe reſtoring times are ſuch as God hath ſpoken of by the mouth of all his holy Prophets, all or moſt of them, have ſome way or other, more or leſs, mentioned this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Kingdom of Chriſt towards the end of

            <p>And thus we ſee by the very firſt Deſign and Platform in Creation, God by making the World by his Son has placed in the whole Creation after its fall and miſery, ever ſince, a natural tendency to come under his mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rule and Dominion, as its only Deliverer and Saviour, and by whom God from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſigned its freedom and happineſs ſhould be retrieved and reſtored.</p>

            <p>The Scripture gives us a poſitive Account of many great and glorious things that will there be effected by the Mediator before his Kingdom ends: the Lord ſhall deſcend accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Clouds, with the Voice of the Archangel, and the Trump of God; the Dead in Chriſt-ſhall riſe firſt, and be caught up with all the Saints then alive, to meet the Lord in the Air, and ſo ſhall be ever with him; this is called the firſt Reſurrection: all his Enemies upon Earth, and the Antichriſtian State ſhall be utterly confounded and ruined, the Heavens and the Earth ſhall be burnt, that is plain in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and probably out of their Aſhes and Ruines will reſult the new Heavens and new Earth, for 'tis not probable that new ones will be intirely created as it was at firſt; 'tis uſual in Scripture to call that a new Creation which is only changed in quality and condition. Some of the Subjects and Inhabitants of this new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and new Earth, will without doubt be the converted <hi>Jews,</hi> at which that paſſage in the 66th of <hi>Eſau</hi> ſeems poſitively to point; <hi>For as the heavens and the earth, which I ſhall make, ſhall remain before me, ſo ſhall your ſeed and your name remain;</hi> that is, they ſhall abide all along the continuance of this new Heaven and this new Earth which I ſhall make, and ſhall be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary therewith. The Prophet in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in the preceding, is largely diſcourſing of theſe glorious times, and of the reſtoration of the <hi>Jews.</hi> This new World will moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably laſt for a 1000 Years; but how, and in what order, and manner, and in what ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59586:49"/>all theſe things will be effected, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the new Heavens and the new Earth will precede the firſt Reſurrection or not, are Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions not pertinent to be asked, becauſe they are as yet impoſſible to be reſolved.</p>
            <p>Thus we have ſeen, by what hath been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſed upon this Argument, how all the great and eternal Deſigns of God, touching this World, were laid in his creation of it by the ſecond Perſon, and that by him all the glorious and bleſſed ends God propoſed to himſelf there by, are brought to paſs and accompliſhed; as all was made by him, ſo all was made for him, and the glory of all reſults to God through him. The Apoſtle in this Epiſtle ſets forth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Qualifications of the bleſſed Perſon of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that the <hi>Jews</hi> might think themſelves no loſers by changing their Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by taking him inſtead of <hi>Moſes;</hi> in reſpect of his Divine Nature, he was infinitely exalted above all compariſons; in reſpect of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, he was exalted above the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; as a Prophet, he exceeded <hi>Moſes,</hi> as far as the Maſter of a Family exceeds his Servant, for he is the Son in his own houſe; and as a Prieſt, he much exceeded <hi>Aaron,</hi> by once for all offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up himſelf a compleat and perfect Sacrifice, and ſhedding thereby the Blood of God for the Sins of the World; and as a King and Prieſt together, by reaſon of his abſolute perfection in Sanctity and Soveraignty, and that he is the great Reconciler of Earth and Heaven, the great Peace-maker between God and Man, he
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59586:49"/>that brings down and proclaims Peace upon Earth and Good-will towards Men, the true King of <hi>Salem;</hi> he infinitely preceded <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech,</hi> having alſo the power of an endleſs Life, and being indeed without beginning or ending of Days, which <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was only in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Figure and in the Type: And through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Epiſtle, ſhews the wonderful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Goſpel above that of the Law, not only from its Original and Founder, but alſo from the Nature and Conſtitution of it, being a heavenly Frame pitch'd by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the other but an earthly one, and all the Appurtenances to it, the Sacrifice, the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Worſhip, the Covenant, and the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the whole ſutable thereunto; and all this to bring the <hi>Jews</hi> to own the truth of their own Religion, to acknowledge their true and natural Meſſiah, of whom as purtaining to the fleſh Chriſt came; after his departure and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, Chriſt, who compaſſionately wept o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and that People, while he was upon Earth, was pleaſed to afford them this glorious Luminary, to follow them with this Inſtruction, and to kindle this Heavenly Lamp before them, that ought to have been a Light to their Feet, and a Lanthorn unto their Paths, to have led them from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> from Mount <hi>Sion</hi> literal to Mount <hi>Sion</hi> ſpiritual, and from the earthly to the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but the ſucceſs proved otherways, for the State of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the governing part of that Nation, together with the Body of the People, continued in the utmoſt rage and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59586:50"/>they could poſſibly expreſs, againſt Chriſt and his Doctrine, till that remove of their oeconomy and Worſhip, which is here but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually and doctrinally laid before them, and tendred to them for their information and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, came to be materially, ſenſibly and dreadfully put in execution, to their utmoſt horror and confuſion.</p>
            <p>That People being chiefly concerned in this Epiſtle, and having been ſo ſtupendious a Stage of ſingular Bleſſings and extraordinary Judgments, a ſhort Digreſſion touching that People and Nation in particular, cannot in this place ſeem either heterogeneal or imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> who were ſo long proprietors of the true God, and in poſſeſſion of the only inſtituted Religion of which he was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, of whom it might for many Ages be ſaid, conſidering and comparing them with the reſt of the World, That Salvation was of the <hi>Jews;</hi> that People that had ſo much advantage above all others every way, and that made ſo great a divine and religious Figure in the World, and ſo true a one, for ſo long together, having in Promiſes, Types, and Significations, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion it ſelf amongſt them, (for out of that Root it ſprang,) there it was in Oar, though it was afterwards coin'd and ſtampt, and that as yet do remain as wonderful Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both of Divine Juſtice and Mercy, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59586:50"/>the Subjects of many Propheſies to be yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled to this very day, a right Account of this People, and a due and ſerious Conſideration of them, cannot but be of excellent uſe to all the ends of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>Their Original was from <hi>Abraham,</hi> they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretended to derive themſelves higher, and therefore encountred our Saviour with what they moſt valued themſelves upon, <hi>We have A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham for our father;</hi> he was the firſt friend God was pleaſed to make to himſelf upon Earth, and with him it was that God perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed the Covenant of Grace in all the Eſſentials and Subſtantials of it, and the legal Covenant, as the Type, Figure and Forerunner of that; in his Natural Capacity he was the Father of the <hi>Jews,</hi> [but reſtrictively by the Seed of the Promiſe in <hi>Iſaac</hi>] with whom the Covenant of Circumciſion was made, an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of great Sanctity and Diſtinction, and whereby they obliged themſelves againſt all falſe Gods and Idolatry, to the Worſhip of the only true God, as he himſelf declared the meaning of it to be; and in his Spiritual Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as one that believed and obeyed what God revealed to him, and followed him fully; he was the Father of all the faithful, who have ever ſince all gone to Heaven by treading in the ſteps of their Father <hi>Abraham:</hi> but this muſt not be ſo ſtrictly taken as if theſe two Seeds of <hi>Abraham</hi> were always ſubjectively di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, for they were often the ſame; and this the Apoſtle proves at large in the 9, 10, 11 Chap. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the Inſtances of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59586:51"/>
                  <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Remnant of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that were at that time ſaved, who were both Heirs according to the Fleſh; and according to the Promiſe, the Goſpel was all virtually utter'd unto him in that one expreſſion, <hi>In thee ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed:</hi> the meaning of which was, that the Promiſe of the Meſſiah having yet lain at large and in very general terms, and proceeded no farther than the firſt Promiſe made of him, that the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpent's Head, God would graciouſly advance one ſtep farther, and not only enlarge that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, by declaring, that in the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but alſo make it known of what People of all the Nations and Kindreds of the Earth the Meſſiah ſhould come, and from whoſe Loins, according to the Fleſh, he ſhould proceed; and this honour is done to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he of all the Perſons upon Earth is fingled out for it, and he is told of God, that in him all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, and this is called after in Scripture, <hi>the bleſſing of Abraham,</hi> [being firſt pronounced to him] which is the Bleſſing of the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> nor is any thing more particularly revealed touching the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> before his actual coming, ſave that out of the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> one particular Tribe is ſingled out, and one Family of that Tribe, and 'tis declared, that Chriſt ſhould come of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and of the Houſe and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage of <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Covenant of Grace was eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> is plain from what the Apoſtle
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59586:51"/>ſays, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>The Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the heathen, through faith, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Goſpel unto Abraham, ſaying in thee ſhall all nations be bleſſed:</hi> which muſt needs be the Goſpel, becauſe it refers to all Nations; what particularly belong'd to the <hi>Jews</hi> went no farther than that Nation; and the ſame Apoſtle, in his grand Diſpute with the <hi>Jews</hi> about Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, proves the Goſpel-Method of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be the true Method, becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified that way, and was of more anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity than the Law, [taking the Law for the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> oeconomy from the original of it] for the firſt beginning of that was Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified in a Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, [that is, had Righteouſneſs imputed to him] before he was circumciſed, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was to him but a Seal of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he had being yet uncircumciſed; from whence the Apoſtle infers, that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs came not by the Law, nor the Operations thereof, but by Faith; this was the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, this of <hi>Abraham's,</hi> in which we find any Man in Scripture juſtified, and 'twas intended to be an Inſtance of God's future and final Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of Believers both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel to the World's end, and that the Law, in the complex Notion of it, was only a School-maſter to conduct and lead Men to Chriſt is very evident, becauſe both the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants were made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Goſpel-Covenant had the precedence, and the other, though firſt in actual execution, was in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but declarative and expreſſive of it, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59586:52"/>conductive to it; and very proper and ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was, that Chriſt ſhould come from the Loins of <hi>Abraham</hi> who ſtood related to God as a publick perſon, not only the natural Father of the <hi>Jew,</hi> but the ſpiritual Father of all the faithful, both <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> for although Chriſt, as concerning the Fleſh, came of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were a holy encloſure unto God, and under his own peculiar Regiment, and it was a ſingular advantage to them to have it ſo, and in ſome reſpect it was abſolutely neceſſary that it ſhould be ſo, that ſo he might be born under the Law, and under an obligation to all the righteouſneſs of the legal Diſpenſation, which he came to fulfil, and might be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Circumciſion [as the Apoſtle ſpeaks] for the truth of God to confirm the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made unto the Fathers, yet he came as a publick Perſon in no ſort confin'd to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, but equally related to all Mankind; and therefore we find, that one of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts derives his Pedegree from <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From a triumvirate of Divine Favorites, Men highly beloved of God, and of great Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Renown, Heirs of all the Promiſes, [for <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> inherited all the Bleſſings of <hi>Abraham</hi>] this People had their Original; in thoſe three God did not only epitomize his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gracious Proceedings with the World in the Covenant of his Grace, and as it were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate himſelf to that triumvirate as their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar property, by ſtiling himſelf the God of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob;</hi> but ſo far honours them after death and when
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59586:52"/>they had left this World, as throughout all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to ſet forth the bleſſed ſtate of the ſaved, by their ſitting down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven, as if the very Company and Preſence of thoſe bleſſed Patriarchs, to whom the Promiſes of Life and Salvation, through the Meſſiah, were firſt perſonally made, would add much to our happineſs there, and as if their ſtate above, were the utmoſt felicity any could hope for, or attain to, for theſe Fathers ſake of theirs they are to this day beloved of God, and God owes them, [for what he promiſes he owes] and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends them a kindneſs, [as ſhall be ſhewn here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after] for their ſakes, for as in thoſe three the natural and the promiſed and ſpiritual Seed did both inhere and concenter; ſo at laſt, their natural Seed according to the Fleſh, ſhall alſo become Heirs of the Promiſe, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it we have from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe <hi>the gifts and callings of God are without repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conſideration of three things will let us into a right account of that People:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That God did intend by the impale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them to himſelf, to put in his Claim to the World, generally run quite away from him into groſs Idolatry, the Worſhip of the Sun, and other parts of the Creation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Subjects of that Kingdom ſet up by the fallen Angels againſt him, by this to challenge a part of the work of his hands, and to have ſome ſelect part of the World ruled and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Laws and Inſtitutions of his own ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the great tendency of which were, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59586:53"/>and over-rule that fatal miſcarriage of Mankind, in worſhipping the Creature inſtead of the Creator, and placing an Idol in the room of the true God; and therefore throughout the whole <hi>Moſaical</hi> Inſtitution, there is a ſacred An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipariſtaſis againſt Idolatry, a total contradiction in every Ceremony of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Worſhip to it, and the whole ſo contrived as to make that People utterly ſeperate themſelves from the Sins of the Nations in that particular, and to bring them up with the utmoſt deteſtation of it. One conſtant Memorial of himſelf in a moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner God by his Law placed amongſt them, which was the obſervance of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, intended as a conſtant weekly Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum againſt Idolatry, and to put them in mind who it was that made the Heavens and the Earth and reſted the ſeventh day from the works of his hands; and upon this account it pleaſed God, that Idolatry and breach of the Sabbath had the ſame puniſhment: And as the Laws and Conſtitutions of this People were thus framed to ſecure them againſt Idolatry, ſo the providential dealings of God with them all along tended this way, God himſelf underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the particular charge and government of them, [which neceſſarily made them a Church and a State conjoyned together] and exerciſing that government in ſuch a way as might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from ſuch a Soveraign, and might in the higheſt manner oblige them to their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, by mighty and open-face diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of himſelf, by ſtupendious Miracles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing Signs and Wonders, and by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59586:53"/>Arm of Power, ſubduing all their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies before them; that People, above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, might utter that Expreſſion, <hi>Say unto God, how terrible art thou in thy doings?</hi> and ſupplying them alſo with whatever they ſtood in need of, and at laſt ſetling them in a Land that was the glory of all Lands, and a Land for which God cared continually, and had his eye ever upon it to make it fruitful; their Story in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> their Travels in the Wilderneſs, and their Poſſeſſion at laſt of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> with the various Events that befel them there, are the profoundeſt and moſt ſtupendious part of all Hiſtory, and the greateſt outward and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Declaration of the mighty Soveraignty that is above, that has been yet made ſince the World began.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God by taking the Government of this handful of People into his own hand, and vouchſafing to be their peculiar Legiſlator, firſt did intend a publick Inſtruction and Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the reſt of the World beſides, and therefore he himſelf declares to them, that the Nations round about them ſhould admire their wiſe Laws; and that proceeded ſo far, and was ſo far verified, that the whole Body of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Laws, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, was by <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> tranſlated into the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, the moſt univerſal Language at that time; and ſo the greateſt part of the World became converſant with it, and it proved a marvellous providential Preparative for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> 'twas eaſie [Prejudice removed] to perceive the difference between
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59586:54"/>the religious Worſhip and Service of the true God, and the ſuperſtitious Follies of Idolatry, between a devout ſerving the Maker and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of all things, and the doting folly of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing; for ſuch is an Idol in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's ſenſe, though it be materially a piece of Stone or Wood or ſome ſuch thing, yet 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that for which 'tis taken to be, and ſo is truly and vertually nothing: And their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was ſo framed, that any Man might become a proſelite and incorporate himſelf into that Religion, that became convinced of the excellency of it. Secondly, This National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was intended to prepare the World for that univerſal Law of the Goſpel, which was to be publiſhed in due time and that two ways: Firſt, By being a ſtanding Monument and conſtant Memorial of the true God and his Worſhip, and a Preſervative of the Notices thereof; And, ſecondly, As it contained in its Bowels a diſcovery, that the Goſpel was that Bleſſing wherewith God intended to bleſs the World from the beginning, and being it ſelf a Witneſs upon Record to it.</p>
               <p>The third thing to conduct us into a right Notion of this People, is to conſider, that the Scripture informs us, that God's whole tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with this People was in a great meaſure with deſign to ſignifie things that ſhould be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of after; they are ſet forth, we are told, for Examples and Types, they were in their very conſtitution the ſhadow of ſomewhat to come, but not the thing it ſelf: In finding out therefore the divine ſignification of this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59586:54"/>People, we ſhall come to the trueſt and beſt comprehenſion of them.</p>
               <p>The firſt and great deſign of God by them was to make way for the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> to make them Harbingers for him, not only in reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them diſtinct from the World, that Chriſt might receive his Humanity from that People, and proceed from them, and ſo from <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the fleſh, but that the offering up of himſelf as a Sacrifice for the World, and the neceſſity and perfection thereof might be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thereby; the whole ceremonial Law was but a preparative Scene for the Goſpel, the end of it was Chriſt's offering up himſelf, and to declare this great truth, that no Humane Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, not the Firſt-born of Mens Bodies, if God had required it, would make a ſufficient Attonement for the Sins of their Souls, but that a better Offering was neceſſary to reconcile God and the World: the Law of the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments the end of it was Chriſt; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs, and Righteouſneſs was the great end of the Law, and ſo Chriſt muſt needs be the end of it; we are expreſly told, <hi>the law written in ſtone is done away;</hi> and it is now only in force as part of the Law natural, and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed by Chriſt, and made part of the new Law of Grace, and obliges upon the terms thereof. Two great ends there were in it, 1st, To diſcover Sin, and thereby the abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a Saviour. 2dly, To reſtrain it until Chriſt's actual coming and the commencement of the Goſpel. In both reſpects it was added,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59586:55"/>becauſe of Tranſgreſſion, and was but a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter ſtill to teach us the Goſpel-Leſſon, and bring us to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God in the depths of his infinite and unfathomable Councels determining with himſelf, that few in reſpect of the body and bulk of Mankind ſhould be finally and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſaved, gave this inſtance of it at firſt, in ſeparating but a ſmall handful of People to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in reſpect of the Nations of the Earth, and making his part and peculiar to conſiſt but of a few, 'tis not to be doubted, but that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Attribute of Grace and Goodneſs in God is rendred more tranſparent to Men than any of the other, yet ſo it pleaſed infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to order it, that the manifeſtation of it ſhould lye in the quality of the ſalvation, rather than in the quantity ſaved; the Righteouſneſs of God in dealing with all Men will be like the great Mountains, but his Judgments herein are like the great Deeps: the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> were in their conſtitution truly Types and Repreſentatives of the Saints and the ſaved Church, and many, very many of them were perſonally of that number, but they had all of them, not one excepted, that ſignification ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenant to them, and literally and typically thoſe Qualifications:</p>
               <p n="1">1st, They were choſen of God and ſeparated from the reſt of the World, and called out to be his peculiar Treaſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, They were devoted and dedicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and had received his mark in their fleſh.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:59586:55"/>
               <p n="3">3dly. They enjoy'd the worſhip of the true God and all divine priviledges.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. Whatever they poſſeſſed they owed it to Gods free donation, even their temporal inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances in the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Now take theſe things in their true and ſpiritual ſenſe and they are the perfect Conſtitution of a true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Believer under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By the whole Tranſactions of God with this People, this general Intimation was given to the World, That no outward Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, though of the moſt advantagious Circumſtances, and accompanied with the moſt prevailing Motives, no Miracles, no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Operations, no Prophets, no Divine Oracles whatever, would reduce Men to their obedience to God, and ſuch a conformity to him, as is abſolutely neceſſary to make them Happy, unleſs there went together with it, ſome Divine Efficacy to change the faculties of Mens minds, and make a Man inwardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing, than what by his degeneracy and apoſtaſie he has made himſelf; nothing did more plainly and evidently diſcover itſelf in the whole tranſaction of God with this People, then that there could be no Law given, that would ſingly, and of itſelf, without foreign Aſſiſtance, introduce Righteouſneſs, that there was an abſolute neceſſity the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be ſent down from Heaven, if ever Mankind were made fit to go thither, and ſuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with the World, as would give to Men a new Heart and a new Spirit, and ſuch a Covenant God declares [having found fault
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59586:56"/>with this] that he would make, whereby he would write his Laws in Mens Hearts, and put them into their inward parts, and ſo poſſeſs them with his Grace, and lock them up to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his fear, that they ſhould not depart from him.</p>
               <p>If we begin with this People in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and conſider them there, it is plain the generality of them had fallen in with the Religion of the Country, [notwithſtanding all the colateral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements they had, and all the obligations they lay under to the contrary] and totally forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the true God; this ſeems plain from what <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Exodus</hi> replied unto God, when he commanded him to go to them, and tell them, <hi>The God of their fathers had ſent him unto them; Moſes</hi> Anſwers, <hi>when I come unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſhall ſay unto them, the God of your fathers hath ſent me unto you, and they ſhall ſay, what is his Name,</hi> or as it is better rendred <hi>[what God is he] what ſhall I ſay unto them?</hi> 'Tis plain from hence, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was well aware of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs he was like to have; and that the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob,</hi> was a thing that the people at that time had no notion at all of, and upon their entrance into <hi>Canaan,</hi> when <hi>Joſhua</hi> had by Gods direction circumciſed them, God himſelf declares, <hi>this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you,</hi> which reproach of <hi>Egypt</hi> was their Idolatry in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was rolled away by their being devoted by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion to the true God and his Worſhip; ſome learned men have ſuppoſed that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were not circumciſed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that their
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59586:56"/>uncircumciſion there was that reproach that was rolled away, but 'tis I conceive a miſtake, for we are told in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. v. 5. <hi>Now all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that came out</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Egypt</hi>) <hi>were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, but all the People that were born in the Wilderneſs by the way as they came forth out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, them they had not circumciſed:</hi> And in the 4. <hi>v.</hi> that is ſaid to be the reaſon of their being now circumciſed; thoſe that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> 'tis expreſly ſaid were circumciſed, now if they were circumciſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> after their coming out, then the reproach of <hi>Egypt</hi> was rolled away before, and this circumciſing could not be it, if they were (as I believe they were) circumciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before they came out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> then uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion could not be the reproach of <hi>Egypt</hi> here meant, and 'tis probable they were all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed there, becauſe <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter ſo ſoon as ſhe had taken <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and looked upon him knew him to be an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Child, which is likely ſhe did by the mark of circumciſion: If you ask how Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and their Idolatry could ſtand together; the anſwer is, They kept up that Right without any regard to the ends of it, juſt as the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> do to this day, who are the greateſt Idolaters in the World though circumciſed, and conſtant obſervers of that Right: No ſooner were they come into the Wilderneſs, though by ſuch ſtupendious deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances as the World before had never been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withal, and although they had a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle [by the Cloud and the Pillar of Fire] always in their eye, yet while <hi>Moſes</hi> was gone
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59586:57"/>into the Mount to treat perſonally with God about their concerns, they fell greedily into the <hi>Egyptain</hi> Idolatry, [a great demonſtration they had been uſed to it before] and ſet up the Calves, to declare in the Higheſt manner their diſloyalty to God their King, their uneaſineſs under his Government, and that his Rule and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Humours would never ſute together; and withal to ſignifie their wretched ingratitude for all he had done for them againſt <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> And to teſtifie their utmoſt ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and delight in what they had ſo done, the Text ſays, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>And they roſe up early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings: and the people ſat down to eat and to drink, and roſe up to play.</hi> Suitable to this was their carriage all along in the Wilderneſs; ſo <hi>Stephen</hi> told their ſucceſſors, that for Forty Years in the Wilderneſs <hi>they took up the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Moloch and the Star of their God Remphan,</hi> Figures which they made to Worſhip them, and had not ſacrificed unto God as they ought: the 78 <hi>Pſalm</hi> is a Holy recapitulation of all the diſloyal undutiful and unthankful treatment God had from them: If we follow them to their laſt ſettlement into <hi>Canaan,</hi> their conſtant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Whoredom there was intolerable, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the moſt high to his face, their whole behaviour was utterly to teſtifie their diſlike of God and his Government, and that they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not him of all others to rule over them, but rather ſubjected themſelves to the meaneſt Idol; the two tribes of <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> that kept longeſt in their Integrity, yet ſoon fell to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59586:57"/>Worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> and before the great Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity they had ſet up the moſt odious Idol-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the very Houſe of God; this was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewn in viſion to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> when he was in <hi>Babylon</hi> upon the firſt Captivity, there he ſaw Men in the Temple worſhipping the Sun, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men weeping for <hi>Tamuz,</hi> and many more Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; and in the 19th of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> God tells them by his Prophet, <hi>Jeruſalem and Judah ſhall be deſtroyed, becauſe they have burnt incenſe to all the hoaſt of heaven.</hi> The ten Tribes early deſerted the true God, and fell down before the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel;</hi> and at laſt, under one of their apoſtate Kings, thoſe Idols were removed to <hi>Samaria,</hi> the Metropolis of the ten Tribes, and placed there to put the utmoſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Credit upon them that poſſibly could be; this was done by <hi>Omri,</hi> of whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture records, <hi>that he did worſe than all that went before him;</hi> becauſe he made Laws to bring theſe Idols from <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> the Royal and Capital City of the ten Tribes, (for ſo it is called in the 7th of <hi>Eſau</hi>) to affront the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the higheſt manner, and as much as in him lay to obliterate the Name and Mention of him amongſt thoſe Tribes in his own choſen and peculiar Country: The Holy Ghoſt has left a perpetual Brand throughout all Ages upon theſe Statutes of <hi>Omri,</hi> and in the 6th of the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> tells the People, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they did ſhould proſper, becauſe <hi>they kept the ſtatutes of Omri;</hi> that is, they went to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> and worſhipped the Calves there, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws and Inſtitutions of <hi>Omri,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59586:58"/>rendring theſe Laws thereby the moſt odious of all their Idolatrous Laws, becauſe <hi>Omri</hi> did not only fall in with <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the reſt of that wicked Crew in their Idolatrous Veneration and Worſhip, but put the higheſt Honour and Countenance imaginable upon thoſe Idols, that ſo they might by them ſuperſede the true God, and root out his Religion for ever.</p>
               <p>The long and ſore Captivity the two Tribes underwent in <hi>Babylon,</hi> proved a cure to them for ought we find of their Idolatry, but they had no inclination to rebuild the Temple, nor to return to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and after their return, they continued in all their other Impieties till they came to the very higheſt they could ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at, which was to be the Betrayers and Murderers of the Son of God himſelf, and by their own importunity to pull down the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful guilt of the moſt ſacred Blood, that alone could ſave them, upon their own and their Poſterities heads. After the Goſpel was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, their rage and oppoſition to it was ſuch, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> notwithſtanding all his love to them, and zeal for them, gives this diſmal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, <hi>that they pleaſed not God, and were contrary to all men,</hi> forbidding the Goſpel [what in them lay] to be preached unto the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the learned and ruling part of them were ſo blinded with prejudice, that they would admit of no Teſtimony that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets gave to our Saviour, though never ſo plain and convincing, nay, they would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that a Prophet could come out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> becauſe Chriſt was of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and yet if they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59586:58"/>had but conſulted the ſecond Book of <hi>Kings, ch.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 25. they had there found, that <hi>Jonah,</hi> one of their eminent Prophets, was of <hi>Gathhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> a chief City in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and belonging to the Tribe of <hi>Zebulon:</hi> and even at their laſt gaſp, when all our Saviour's Predictions in the 24th of <hi>Matthew</hi> and in the other Evangeliſts came to be executed upon them, when they ſaw the abomination of deſolation before their eyes, that was, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> encompaſſed with Armies, and <hi>Titus</hi> beſieging them, the Hiſtory of their vile and ſhameful behaviour then, is ſcarce credible, were it not transferr'd to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity by one of themſelves there perſonally preſent.</p>
               <p>The Natural Inſtruction of all this, and of the whole Behaviour of that People under all thoſe outward Means and Priviledges they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, is, That the Goſpel became neceſſary, God might well ſay as to all outward Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, after his Tranſactions with this People, What could I have done more to my Vineyard that I have not done? yet have no Fruit. Had not this tryal been made, the Goſpel-glory had not ſhone ſo bright, nor had the World known the Value of that ineſtimable Effect of Chriſt's Purchaſe and Aſcenſion, the ſending down the Holy Ghoſt from Heaven to compleat the Work of Man's Salvation, and to ſanctifie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make and ſave the World.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By this Covenant of peculiarity God enter'd into with the <hi>Jews,</hi> founded as upon outward Diſpenſations, ſo alſo upon tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Rewards and Puniſhments, he would by
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59586:59"/>the punctual and exact performance in both kinds, inſure to the World, the poſitive certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe future Rewards and Puniſhments the Goſpel propoſeth to us in the World to come; upon this account we find with great exactneſs the effects both of God's Juſtice and Mercy to this People. Hence may be learned how great is his Goodneſs, and how dreadful alſo is his Juſtice: What People were ever ſo bleſſed as this People? ever ſo born with and forgiven as they were? never were they failed in any one temporal Promiſe, thô they were all made with Conditions of Obedience annexed; they ſeem to be at the utmoſt pitch and enjoyment of all their temporal Promiſes in the days of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Grandeur and Splendor of that Court was exceeding great and magnificent, and great Homage paid to it by all the Nations round about; the Holy Ghoſt records that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Heavenly Benediction that attended thoſe happy Days, and tells us they were Times wherein there was neither evil Accident nor Occurrent: but the end of his Reign ſhews us how fading and decaying we ſhall find all created Happineſs, and that the end of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Promiſes is at laſt but a Grave and Room to repoſe our Bodies; this was ſignified to and certainly well underſtood by <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who lived to poſſeſs nothing in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> but a Burying-place, the Field of <hi>Mach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelah;</hi> they were inſtructed to look after better things through thoſe, [though their Poſterity did not] a heavenly Country was in their eye, and a City that has Foundations, whoſe Builder
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59586:59"/>and Maker is God; and therefore it is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, <hi>God was not aſhamed to be called their God;</hi> becauſe their hopes and expectations were not earthly, but ſuitable to ſuch a Being and Benefactor as he is, and ſuch as he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe ſhould have whom he intended to honour and own for his; for Twenty nine Years of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Reign, the whole Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came up to the Temple at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and worſhipped in the Beauties of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs there; then was verified what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays ſo elegantly and emphatically in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122. <hi>Jeruſalem is builded as a city that is compact toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord unto the teſtimony of Iſrael, to give thanks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Name of the Lord, for there are ſet thrones of judgment, the thrones of the houſe of David.</hi> But Twenty nine Years was but a ſmall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of time, their ſins ſhortned thoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py days, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> literal was not compacted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Ten Tribes went off and apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the firſt Year of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and never came to worſhip there more.</p>
               <p>The Judgments of God upon this People have been ſtupendious and dreadful, no part of the World have drunk ſo deep of the Cup of God's Severity as they have, and God himſelf interprets this to us, when he tells us in the Third of <hi>Amos, You only have I known of all the nations of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities:</hi> You have I ſingled out of all the Earth to make both my Mercy and my Juſtice known by, that all the World might underſtand me, by my proceedings with you;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59586:60"/>as I have diſcovered more Grace and Favour to you than to all the World beſides, to let Mankind know my Nature is not cruel, but that I am the Lord merciful and gracious, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering and ſlow to anger, yet at laſt will not ſpare the guilty; ſo will I punctually puniſh you, and that before all the World, for your manifold Iniquities, that my Juſtice thereby may be alſo made manifeſt. God's ſharp Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with them in the Wilderneſs, devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by Death; their ſad and dreadful Captivities out of the Promiſed Land, when they were ſetled there; their being in the juſt judgment of God left to Betray and Crucifie their long expected <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the dreadful Judgment that in a few Years after befel them thereupon, ending in the total ruin both of their Church and State, and their miſerable forlorn Condition to this hour, are all ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Evidences of this Truth.</p>
               <p>The ten Tribes, for their abominable Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries, were early removed and captiv'd by <hi>Salmanaſer,</hi> and to this day never again heard of, ſeem as loſt, only ſurvive in the Promiſes made for their reſtoration, and all we know of them is, that the Scripture tells us out of what places at laſt they ſhall be recalled. The other two Tribes, about a Hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years after or ſomewhat more, went into <hi>Babilon,</hi> ſuffering the loſs of all in a ſore Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; they returned indeed and continued a petty inconſiderable State, which was at the beſt under the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> till Chriſt came; but then when the glory of all they hoped for,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59586:60"/>and the ſubſtance of all their Religion ſignified, appeared, then was the Judgment of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated upon them. What account can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of this, that theſe peculiar People of God, in covenant with him above all the Earth, to whom the Promiſes of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> were chiefly and primarily made, of whoſe fleſh he came, that they of all the World ſhould be his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers; what account, I ſay, but this, that God would compleat his Judgments for all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions upon them above all others? and 'tis a thing of great remark and obſervation, that in the 6th <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where that fatal and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the advantage they might have had from Chriſt and the Goſpel at his coming, is foretold and recorded; we never find God more gloriouſly magnified, nor his praiſe more celebrated in Heaven, than upon this occaſion: <hi>In the year that king Uzziah died, I ſaw alſo the Lord ſitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it ſtood the ſeraphims: each one had ſix wings; with twain he covered his face, with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. And one cried unto another, and ſaid, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hoſts, the whole earth is full of his glory. And the poſts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the houſe was filled with ſmoke.</hi> And in the 8th Verſe, <hi>Alſo I heard the voice of the Lord, ſaying, Whom ſhall I ſend, and who will go for us? Then ſaid I, Here am I, ſend me. And he ſaid, Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but underſtand not, and ſee ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59586:61"/>their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes: leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand with their heart, and convert and be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Then ſaid I, Lord, how long? And he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Until the cities be waſted without inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and the houſes without man, and the land be utterly deſolate.</hi> So clear and evidently juſt were God's proceedings with this People, in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to reject Chriſt and the Goſpel, who had ſo often and ſo long rejected him, and bring at laſt a total ruin upon themſelves, their City and whole Country by the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the whole heavenly Hoaſt admire and adore his Actings herein, and give their utmoſt Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage thereunto.</p>
               <p>But although all theſe Miſeries have befallen this People, and all the Judgments threatned in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> have been moſt righteouſly executed upon them, yet God, according to his ancient Promiſe, has not totally and utterly deſtroyed them, but has ſubjected them in hope, and will at laſt revive them with a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and merciful Revival and Reſurrection; which is the Point ſhall be laſt conſidered about this People.</p>

                  <hi>Touching the Calling of the</hi> Jews.</head>
               <p>The Calling of the <hi>Jews</hi> is a Matter that has been variouſly treated of, and there has been conſiderable Advocates on both ſides; but to me it ſeems, that no Man that with due dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence reads what the Scriptures informs us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Matter, can fairly deny, but that the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59586:61"/>
                  <hi>Jews</hi> will at laſt be called into the Chriſtian Church, and embodied with it, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration will be very glorious; the whole ſtream of the prophetick part of the Old Teſtament runs this way, God has upon all occaſions by his Prophets declared himſelf very plain in this Point, that he would not by any of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments utterly raze that People out of the World, but that there ſhould be hope in their end, and that although he had in puniſhing many other Nations made a full end with them, that their Names ſhould be no more remembred, yet he would not do ſo with the <hi>Jews,</hi> for he had married himſelf unto them, and although he would with the exacteſt ſeverity puniſh them for their Sins and take vengeance upon their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, yet he would not make a full end with them, but reſerve them to be Objects and Spectacles of his Mercy at the laſt: ſo in the 31ſt of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> he declares, <hi>That the ſun, moon, and ſtars, ſhould as ſoon ceaſe from enlightning the world, as the ſeed of Iſrael ceaſe from being a nation before him for ever;</hi> which in a great meaſure our own eyes behold made good at this day, in the forementioned 6th of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where their rejection from the advantages of the Goſpel at its firſt publication and to this day is ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and dreadfully declared by the Prophet; the laſt Verſe of that <hi>Chapter</hi> is a plain witneſs to this, <hi>But yet in it ſhall be a tenth, and it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and be eaten: as a teil-tree, and as an oak whoſe ſubſtance is in them when they caſt their leaves: ſo the holy ſeed ſhall be the ſubſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> Though they look like a dead Tree with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               </p>
               <p>To ſet down all that the Prophets have left upon record, touching this reſtoration of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the laſt, were to tranſcribe a conſiderable part of their Writings, and therefore I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my ſelf in the proof of this Point to a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs, and inſiſt only upon ſome few Scripture Evidences, but ſuch as I take to be very concluding and enough to convince in this matter.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If there appear any Promiſes in the Old Teſtament for the reſtoring and recovering of the ten Tribes, as there appear very many that <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be again united, and thoſe two broken and divided Sticks made into one, then 'tis paſt queſtion, that thoſe Promiſes are yet to be made good and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; the ten Tribes have never yet been reſtored ſince they were captived by <hi>Shalmane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,</hi> and God himſelf declared by his Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> in the firſt of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> that he would make a great difference between the Captivity of the ten Tribes, and the other two, in point of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and continuance of time, even ſo far, that the ten Tribes ſhould ſeem as utterly caſt away, yet in the 10th and 11th Verſes he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes they ſhall be at laſt reſtored and embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died with the other two.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When God ſpeaks by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as he very often does, of a ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration that he would vouchſafe the <hi>Jews,</hi> 'tis as I conceive very plain, that it is yet to come, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59586:62"/>cannot be interpreted to be already paſt: The Text I ſhall chiefly inſiſt on for both theſe Points, is in the 11th Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Verſe the 11th, and ſo to the end of the Chapter. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in that day, that the Lord ſhall ſet his hand the ſecond time, to recover the remnant of his people which ſhall be left, from Aſſyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cuſh, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the iſlands of the ſea. And he ſhall ſet an enſign for the nations, and ſhall aſſemble the outcaſts of Iſrael, and gather together the diſperſed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.</hi> And Verſe the 16th, <hi>There ſhall be a high-way for the remnant of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which ſhall be left from Aſſyria, like as it was unto Iſrael in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.</hi> This ſeems a direct foretelling of the recovery of the ten Tribes out of their capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, for theſe were the very places whither they were carried and diſperſed; but the two Tribes we know were captived into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> here is not ſo much as once named; and there were many particular Propheſies that concerned the recovery of the two Tribes from thence: In the 49th Chapter of this Propheſie we find great Joy and Admiration expreſſed by the two Tribes, under the name of <hi>Sion,</hi> [by which they are very often expreſſed; and well might they be ſo, the other Tribes being gone, and they only in poſſeſſion of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Temple, and the true Worſhip] at the reſtoration of the ten Tribes: Verſe 21. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſay in thy heart,</hi> [ſpeaking of <hi>Sion] Who hath begotten me theſe, ſeeing I have loſt my children and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59586:63"/>am deſolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up theſe? Behold, I was left alone, theſe where had they been?</hi> They looked on them as loſt, but now behold them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing and wonder.</p>
               <p>The plain meaning of the Propheſie ſeems to be, that as God had graciouſly recovered the two Tribes out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſo he would ſet his hand the ſecond time, to recover the ten Tribes out of thoſe remote Countries where they were captived and diſperſed, and make a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of all the Tribes; and this Propheſie, as I conceive, is not yet fulfilled, for it relates evidently to the times of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally granted both by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſo to do, and then to be fulfilled; according to the judicious Note of <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place, <hi>Ita<expan>

               <p>Two things are objected againſt this, to prove that this ſecond Deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> often promiſed, is not yet to come, but is already paſs'd.</p>
               <p>Firſt 'tis ſaid, That this ſecond Deliverance is ſpoken with reference to that out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:59586:63"/>which is meant as firſt, and the Deliverance out of <hi>Babylon</hi> as this ſecond; but this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is wonderful impotent, for beſides that it does not cohere nor fit the caſe, becauſe the People were not captived in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but came at firſt voluntarily thither, and were after bred and born there, though they were we know kept in ſore bondage, yet they were not Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives there; 'tis to make the Prophet intend otherways than he ſpeaks, and that when he ſays God would a ſecond time bring the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and <hi>Cuſh,</hi> and <hi>Elam,</hi> he meant, he would a ſecond time bring them out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> and ſhould it be admitted, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were, when they came out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> called out of all thoſe places, yet it was but the firſt time, and this ſecond Call muſt needs be yet to come: But the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> decides this Matter, and puts it out of all queſtion, for after the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Reſtoration was over, he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieth the very ſame thing, and directly foretells the reſtoration of the ten Tribes, <hi>Zach.</hi> 10. v. 9, 10. <hi>They ſhall remember me in far countries, and I will bring them again out of the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and gather them out of Aſſyria, and I will bring them to the land of Gilead and Lebanon.</hi> The <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> reſtoration could not be this, that God ſays he would <hi>again</hi> bring about, for that was effected when the Prophet wrote, and the two Tribes were at that time come home, and in their own Country: So that 'tis very plain, there was a ſecond Reſtoration of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be, after the Deliverance out of <hi>Babylon</hi> was over.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:59586:64"/>
               <p>Secondly 'tis ſaid, That this ſecond Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews</hi> the Prophets ſo much point at, and ſo often foretel, was accompliſh'd at the coming of Chriſt by thoſe Converts amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> that then embraced the Goſpel; but this is utterly out of the way of all right reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about this matter, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> abſolutely denies, that the converſion of that remnant of the <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe times, that thoſe few that then received the Goſpel, that that was the glorious ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> foretold and propheſied of in the Old Teſtament, which he calls their ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, [though it was an evidence God had not even then totally caſt off his People] but on the contrary, looks upon that ſeaſon as their very loweſt ebb, and calls that ſeaſon their fall, their diminiſhing, their caſting away; and in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ch. 3. he tells us, <hi>their minds were blinded, for until this day</hi> (ſays he) <hi>remains the vail untaken away in the reading the Old Teſtament;</hi> [that is, he means upon the bulk and body of that People] which Vail he tells you in the 16th Verſe, when it ſhall turn to the Lord ſhall be taken away; but at that day when he wrote the Vail remained upon them. In the 11th of the <hi>Romans,</hi> v. 11. <hi>By their fall</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſalvation is come to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and clearly refers it to another ſeaſon, that is, when the fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be come in, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have their fulneſs, and then all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved, and Chriſt not only be a Light to lighten the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> but the Glory of his People <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for, ſays he, God has concluded them [that is, the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59586:64"/>bulk and body of them] at this time under un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, that he might hereafter have mercy upon them all.</p>
               <p>'Tis alſo farther objected upon the whole matter, 1st, That the ten Tribes were never loſt, nor are not in any ſenſe extinct; 2dly, That what calling they were to have is paſt already. He that affirms the firſt is obliged to tell us what came of the ten Tribes ſince their Captivity, and give ſome good ſatisfying account where they now are, which there is not a Man upon Earth that can do: He that affirms the ſecond muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhew when they were called and reſtored, or elſe muſt deny that there are any promiſes made for it, for if it be promiſed in Scripture, that <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be again united, as 'tis plain enough to be, and the ten Tribes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; then if thoſe promiſes do not appear yet to have been fulfilled, 'tis an invincible argument that the fulfilling of them is yet to come, for the Scripture cannot be broken, but muſt have its punctual accompliſhment one time or other.</p>
               <p>But to come to a due and right conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe two things, it will be neceſſary to take a view of their original Captivity, the Hiſtory of which we have in the ſecond Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> chap. 17. In the time of <hi>Hoſhea's</hi> Raign, <hi>Shalmaneſer</hi> came up againſt <hi>Samaria,</hi> the Capital City of the ten Tribes, and after three Years ſiege took it; and the Text ſays, <hi>carried Iſrael away into Aſſyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:</hi> And in the 18th <hi>verſe,</hi> after a recapitulation of all their heinous and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59586:65"/>God-provoking ſins, 'tis ſaid, <hi>Therefore the Lord was very angry with Iſrael, and removed them out of his ſight: there was none left but the tribe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah only,</hi> under which name, that part of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> that adhered to <hi>Judah</hi> is comprehended; for a Conſiderable part of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> joyned with the ten Tribes in the Idolatry of the Calves, and underwent their Fate: And in the 24th <hi>verſe</hi> tis ſaid, <hi>The King of Aſſyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cutha, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria, inſtead of the children of Iſrael; and they poſſeſſed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;</hi> by which 'tis plain, they were ſo effectually removed out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that they were placed in a far and remote Country, and their own Country was Peopled with other Inhabitants; a thing very unuſual and rarely, if ever heard of in Conquer'd Nations, and in which a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Hand of God ſeems to appear; and this continued till our Saviour's time, for the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the ten Tribes was much of it poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> then with a mixture of ſome <hi>Jews;</hi> which <hi>Jews</hi> were moftly of the two Tribes that returned out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who, after their return, got into poſſeſſion of divers parts belonging to the ten Tribes formerly, the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans,</hi> who inhabited a very conſiderable part of the inheritance of the ten Tribes, were all <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and well known to remain there ever ſince <hi>Shalmaneſer's</hi> Conqueſt, and had the <hi>Jews</hi> in the utmoſt deteſtation, and would have no converſe with them of any ſort, this is all
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59586:65"/>briefly expreſſed by <hi>Grotius</hi> in his judicious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation upon the 4th Verſe of the 4th Chapter of <hi>John, Samariam intellige</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>illam par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Terrae promiſſe in quâ manſerunt aſſyrii poſt quam caetera decem tribubus olim poſſeſſa Judaei a Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia reduces receperunt, ab urbe enim olim regni ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite nomen manſit regioni,</hi> by all which it appears ſufficiently evident that in our Saviours time, the ten Tribes were not come back, but their Country was generally poſſeſſed by <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> of the two Tribes, tis like ſome few of the ten Tribes might be amongſt them, though <hi>Shalmaneſer</hi> did not leave ſuch numbers behind him as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did, but ſwept the Country more clear in order to a new Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of it; So clear that it appears by the 27th Verſe of the 17th Chapter of the ſecond Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> That not one individual Prieſt was left in the whole Country; by which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence God ſeemed to point at the long and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duration of that Captivity, and the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of any ſudden return, whatever ſmall part of the ten Tribes might poſſibly ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind or get into other adjacent Countrys, are not ſure to be reckoned for the ten Tribes, when all the Ruling part and the Bulk and Body of them were gone, no more then thoſe <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> left (though they far exceeded in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) were to be reckoned for the two Tribes, when the chief of them and the Bulk of them were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Scripture every where reckons the two Tribes to be there during their Captivity, and above fifty Thouſand returned, thoſe few of the ten Tribes that were in <hi>Canaan</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:59586:66"/>in our Saviours time were of three ſorts, Firſt, ſuch as upon the firſt ſetting up of the Calves by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had fled to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers did) to enjoy the true worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God and ſetled there; thoſe upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the ten Tribes by <hi>Shalmaneſer</hi> 'tis likely might at leaſt ſome of them return home to their former Inheritances: 2dly, Thoſe few that were left behind when <hi>Shalmaneſer</hi> tranſplanted them, for ſome few of the meaner poorer ſort were probably left: And 3dly, Thoſe that upon the decree of <hi>Cyrus</hi> came back which ſome few people did, that were near home and had fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the adjacent Countrys, but the Bulk and Body of the ten Tribes were gone, and had not then returned, nor have they had any reſtoration to this day, but remain, as to our knowledge of them, buried and loſt in their firſt Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why <hi>Shalmaneſer</hi> placed them in <hi>Halah</hi> and <hi>Habor</hi> by the River <hi>Gozan</hi> and in the Cities of the <hi>Medes,</hi> may well be collected from hence, 1st, That thoſe were the moſt uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited places of any parts of his Dominions; And 2dly, Becauſe thoſe places were at ſo very great a diſtance from the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that they might have no thoughts nor opportunities of returning, and for the matter of fact of theſe two reaſons, it is proved from <hi>Strabo</hi> and the beſt <hi>Geographers:</hi> now the ten Tribes being ſo circumſtanced at firſt in their Captivity, 'tis very probable to believe they ſetled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there, or were by (to us) unknown ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents removed, till all the Memorials of them
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59586:66"/>were as now they be quite loſt and extinguiſhed: this Captivity of the ten Tribes was above a 120 Years before the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, and there is not the leaſt colour of proof they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned during that time; Nay, 'tis certain they remained in Captivity, when the other two Tribes were in <hi>Babylon;</hi> but 'tis urged by ſome, and great ſtreſs laid upon it to little effect, that they being within the Dominions of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and his decree reaching all his Territories, they might return when the two Tribes came out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> for his decree ſet them all at liberty ſo to do, but this comes to no more then argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a bare poſſibility againſt a plain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact to the contrary: The propheſies and promiſes that concern the Reſtoration and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> are not to be reckoned as fulfilled and accompliſhed from any poſſibilities or probabilities that they might be ſo in any age, that were to trifle with God's veracity, but from an actual, ſpecifical execution and performance: The ten Tribes I acknowledge, were within the Dominions of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and by that decree might have returned, but 'tis certain in fact the Body of them did not, and that is eaſily ſuppoſed in the general, becauſe we find thoſe that had been but a few Years ſetled in <hi>Babylon</hi> were loath to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and much more might the ten Tribes that were at ſo great a diſtance, and when the two Tribes came out of <hi>Babylon</hi> had been ſetled in thoſe remote parts very near two hundred Years, and all thoſe dead long before that knew the Country, and had been perſonally removed from thence, and that they did not return is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59586:67"/>proved from <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. v. 1. And from <hi>Neh.</hi> 7. and the 6th Verſe, where 'tis expreſly ſaid, thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that returned into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> were thoſe that had been carried away by <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar;</hi> and we are further aſſured, they conſiſted only of the two Tribes, becauſe they took ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them and regiſtred them by their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies, and Families, and ſo they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned every one to their own City, and 'tis ſaid they came to <hi>Judah</hi> every one to their own City; <hi>Eſdras</hi> was one of them that returned out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and by his ſecond Book it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, (ſo far as his Authority goes) that they reckoned the ten Tribes to remain then in their captivity, and ſhews how they had ſetled themſelves there, and thoſe that then lived muſt needs know that matter: True it is, that from the Decree in the firſt Year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to the ſixth Year of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> when the Temple was finiſhed, was 46 Years; ſo long was it e're the Temple was compleated, reckoning, beſides the times of its actual building, thoſe of the ſtops and intervals that interpoſed; and to that the <hi>Jews</hi> relate, when they told our Saviour, Forty ſix Years was this Temple in building: during which time ſome few ſcattered <hi>Jews</hi> belonging to the ten Tribes, that had fled upon <hi>Shalmane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi>'s conqueſt into the adjacent parts, returned into <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> but it does not appear that they were of any other Tribes, but thoſe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh:</hi> but this was ſo inconſiderable a thing, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the return of the whole ten Tribes, that in <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> no notice at all is taken of it; and the building of the City and the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59586:67"/>Temple, and re-peopling the Country, is wholly aſcribed to the two Tribes that went out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Now no Man can think, if he would, that if that vaſt body of the ten Tribes had been then reſtored, but that they would have had a great hand in reſetling that Country, and eminent mention would have been made by the Holy Ghoſt of it. So that 'tis plain the body of the ten Tribes ſetled by <hi>Shalmaneſer</hi> by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Gozan</hi> and in the Cities of the <hi>Medes,</hi> came not back upon <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Decree, but in the wiſe and ſecret Providence of God were reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for a more glorious Reſtoration, which is yet to come.</p>
               <p>From the rebuilding the Temple, till our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's time, there is not the leaſt intimation in any ſtory of the return of the ten Tribes: In <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi>'s time they were diſpers'd all over the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire; that is plain from what <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſaid to King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> in the third of <hi>Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, There is a certain people</hi> (ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews) ſcattered abroad and diſperſed among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all the provinces of thy kingdom.</hi> And I think 'tis utterly impoſſible to find any Call or Converſion of them to this day, ſuch as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of, ſuch a body as thoſe Ten Tribes muſt needs conſiſt of, could be never called or reſtored, without fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the World with a very great Story; ſince our Saviour's time, we hear of nothing but Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon that People, of their Slaughter and Ruine by <hi>Titus, Trajan, Adrian,</hi> and other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, but not a word of any Reſtoration or general Converſion of the body of the ten
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59586:68"/>Tribes that were carried ſo far eaſtward; ſome ſpeak much of the flouriſhing of the Chriſtian Religion in <hi>Judea</hi> and about <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in and after <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, but that did not ariſe what ever it was from the number of <hi>Chriſtian Jews</hi> there, ſo much as from the great conflux of other Chriſtians that came from all Parts, and many of them ſetled their Dwellings there with reſpect to the holy Sepulchre, and the City and Country where our Saviour had lived and wrought all his Miracles.</p>
               <p>The ten Tribes, as to any knowledge we have of them, are certainly the bulk and body of them loſt; he that will deny it, is obliged to prove what is become of them, and where they be; but 'tis no good Argument to infer from thence, that either they are totally, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and really loſt, or ſhall never be recalled; 'tis out of the compaſs of all rational conception to think ſuch a vaſt number of People ſhould be wholly extinct and not propagate Poſterity, no inſtance can be given of any ſuch thing; but their being does not at all depend upon our knowledge of their being, they may exiſt in many parts of the World, and we not know it, and ſo may be loſt as to us, though not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; 'twould be no good way of arguing, to deny the exiſtence of all parts of the World, and all Inhabitants of it, that are not to us particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly known and diſcovered: And as to their Calling, it is a very potent Argument to me they ſhall be called, becauſe they are at the preſent in ſuch a loſt unknown ſtate; for the Prophets, and eſpecially <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> do in many
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59586:68"/>places intimate, that their condition by the ordination of God ſhould be ſuch, that they ſhould ſeem as utterly loſt and paſt all hope of recovery; ſo <hi>Sion</hi> is introduced, ſpeaking, <hi>Who hath begotten me theſe, ſeeing I have lost my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?</hi> The Prophet <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſeems to point at their wonderful recovery, in that expreſſion, <hi>I will remove the iniquity of the land in one day;</hi> and alſo the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> when he ſays, <hi>Who hath heard ſuch a thing? who hath ſeen ſuch things? ſhall the earth be made to bring forth in one day, or ſhall a nation be born at once? for as ſoon as Sion travelled ſhe brought forth her children.</hi> And the whole Scripture ſeems to deſign it as a moſt glorious Work of God's Power, wherein he would eminently appear to call home thoſe his ancient People, out of a moſt forlorn, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly loſt and deſperate condition; and Saine <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who beſt underſtood this matter, calls their recovery and reſtoration, in the 11th of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which, as he ſays, there was after that time to happen, <hi>life from the dead.</hi> 2dly, 'Tis ſaid by ſome, That what Calling they are to have, is paſſed already; and this they chiefly ground upon what was diſcourſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of the Advantages they had by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in the time of our Saviour and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and what Numbers of them were then converted, in ſo much that the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is directed to the believing <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> write to the twelve Tribes ſcattered: That ſome of the ten Tribes, as well as of the other two, did embrace the Goſpel in thoſe times, is out of queſtion, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59586:69"/>that the Apoſtles met with many of them in <hi>Heathen</hi> Countries, where they went to preach, is very evident; the occaſion of their diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, beſides thoſe common accidents by which Nations come to inhabit and dwell one amongſt another, was chiefly upon this twofold account: 1st, Whereſoever they were at any time car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried captive, many of them ſtayed behind and never returned: And, 2dly, When they were to be removed as Captives by their Conquerors, many of them, fearing the conſequences of their Captivity, fled into other Countries, to conceal themſelves, and there continued; and ſo the Apoſtles found ſome of them almoſt every where diſperſed, as they went about preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and occaſionally converted part of them: and upon that account thoſe Epiſtles are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Strangers ſcattered, and to the twelves Tribes, reckoning a part for the whole, and to keep up the Honour and Memory of the Tribes, and to make good St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That God even then, had not quite caſt off his People; though 'tis likely of ſome of the ten Tribes there were but a very few that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Chriſtians, a very mean, ſmall, inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable handful, in reſpect of the body and bulk of them.</p>
               <p>But let the Converſion the <hi>Jews</hi> had in the Apoſtles times be put as far as it will or can be put, it is certain, if St. <hi>Paul</hi> be infallible, that thoſe that make that to be the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Reſtoration of that People, foretold in the Old Teſtament, are undoubtedly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; for all the <hi>Jews</hi> that were then convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59586:69"/>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 11th of the <hi>Romans,</hi> makes to be no more than a ſmall Remnant, like that in the time of <hi>Elias,</hi> which <hi>Elias</hi> did not ſee it was ſo inconſiderable, and oppoſeth it to the bulk and body of that People; no Man would think it a reaſonable and fair dealing with the Scriptures, if any ſhould ſay, that in <hi>Elias</hi> his time, the body of the <hi>Jews</hi> were free from the Idolatry of <hi>Baal,</hi> becauſe ſeven thouſand of them were; 'tis the ſame thing to ſay, the <hi>Jews</hi> were called and reſtored to the Church in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times, becauſe a ſmall Remnant of them were then converted; St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as plain as words can expreſs, diſtinguiſheth between the Call of that Remnant then, and the general Call of that People which he terms their Fulneſs, and which he refers all along to a future ſeaſon, when the fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be come in: 'twere a ſtrange thing to conceive, that that Seaſon wherein the Holy Ghoſt tells us, Wrath was come upon that People to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt, that that ſhould be the Seaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the glorious Predictions concerning their Call and Reſtoration ſhould be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
               <p>And 'tis not to be paſſed over, without much obſervation, that the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> having in the forementioned 11th Chapter of his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſo poſitively foretold the reſtoration of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and particularly of the ten Tribes, and in the laſt Verſe of that Chapter declared, <hi>There ſhall be a high-way for the remnant of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which ſhall be left from Aſſyria, like as it was to Iſrael in the day that he came up out of the land
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59586:70"/>of Egypt.</hi> The twelfth Chapter following is the very Song <hi>in Terminis</hi> ſet down and indicted by the Holy Ghoſt, which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall ſing at that glorious time of their recovery and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Chap. 12. <hi>And in that day thou ſhalt ſay,</hi> O <hi>Lord, I will praiſe thee: though thou waſt angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comforteſt me. Behold, God is my ſalvation: I will truſt, and not be afraid; for the Lord Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah is my ſtrength, and my glory, he alſo is become my ſalvation. Therefore with joy ſhall ye draw wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the wells of ſalvation. And in that day ſhall ye ſay, Praiſe the Lord, call upon his Name, declare his doings amongst the people, make mention that his Name is exalted. Sing unto the Lord, for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth. Cry out and ſhout thou inhabitant of Sion: for great is the holy One of Iſrael in the midst of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that as there was a ſolemn Song ſung unto God, upon the mighty deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for 'tis ſaid in <hi>Exodus, than ſang Moſes and the children of Iſrael this ſong;</hi> even ſo upon this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and wonderful reſtoration and recovery of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall this ſolemn Song of Thankſgiving be ſung by them all, to the Praiſe and Honour of that great God, that hath brought again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether theſe poor dry Bones, and made a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Nation of them, and has remembred his Promiſe of old, to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and declared thereby his faithfulneſs and truth to this his ancient Inheritance, according to that of the <hi>Pſalmist, He hath remembred his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59586:70"/>to a thouſand generations, which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Iſaac, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the ſame unto Jacob for a Law, and to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael for an everlaſting covenant.</hi> Though their Poſterity, by their ſins, have brought a long ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion upon theſe Promiſes, yet the Entail is not cut off, for it ſhall laſt through a thouſand Generations.</p>
               <p>In the New Teſtament this Point is largely diſcuſſed, and as I conceive very plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> having profeſſed there his great zeal for, and love to, the <hi>Jews,</hi> that were his own fleſh, he propoſeth this Queſtion, <hi>Hath God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>cast away his people?</hi> He anſwers it with the moſt ſacred, and withal the moſt vehement and abhorrent Negation, <hi>God forbid;</hi> juſt as he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers that Queſtion in the 6th Chapter, <hi>Shall we ſin, that grace may abound?</hi> (which was one of the vileſt ſcandals that could be put upon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine and the Goſpel,) He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>God forbid.</hi> So that the caſe is ſo far very clear, that God has not caſt off his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and 'twere a great piece of impiety, when we reflect upon the Promiſes made to them, and the Propheſies yet unfulfilled concerning them, ſo to think. The Apoſtle makes good this point, that God had not caſt off his People, by this twofold anſwer to that Queſtion; 1st, That ſome of them, amongſt whom himſelf was one, had embraced the Goſpel at that time, and that although the bulk of that People remained in unbelief, yet 'twas then as 'twas in <hi>Elias</hi> his time, there was a remnant of Believers amongſt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59586:71"/>them according to the election of Grace; ſo that God had not quite caſt off his People even then. And, 2dly, He anſwers, that hereafter, when the fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be come in, that Blindneſs, that then in part happened unto them, ſhould be removed, and ſo all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be ſaved: His words are in the 25th and 26th Verſes, <hi>For I would not, brethren, that you ſhould be ignorant of this myſtery, lest you ſhould be wiſe in your own conceits, that blindneſs in part is happened to Iſrael, until the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in. And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved: as it is written, There ſhall come out of Sion the deliverer, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from Jacob.</hi> He tells the <hi>Gentiles</hi> before, that they were like a wild Olive grafted into a good Olive, and did partake of the Root and Fatneſs of it; they muſt not boaſt againſt the Branches, for thou doſt not bear the Root, [ſays he] but the Root thee: The Apoſtle brings in the only objection the <hi>Gentiles</hi> could make in the 19th Verſe, <hi>Thou wilt ſay, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in. Well; becauſe of unbelief they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by Faith. Be not high-minded, but fear.</hi> And in the 24th Verſe tells them, <hi>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive-tree; how much more ſhall theſe that be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive-tree?</hi> The Apoſtle in theſe Verſes intimates to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that he would not have them exalt themſelves too much over the <hi>Jews,</hi> and therefore reveals to them this Myſtery, that Blindneſs was happened in part
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59586:71"/>unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> until the Fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould come in, and then all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be ſaved; and for this quotes that paſſage in the 59th of <hi>Iſaiah, There ſhall come out of Sion the deliverer, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from Jacob:</hi> The plain meaning of which, and of the Context all along, is this, that the converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould not over magnifie themſelves, as if they were ſo the true Church, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excluded; for as ſome of them embraced the Goſpel then, ſo the excluſion of the reſt was but for a time, till the fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould come in, and then the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have their fulneſs alſo, and ſo all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and have ſuch a reviving as he calls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>life from the dead;</hi> the converſion of ſome <hi>Jews</hi> at that time [amongſt which was St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles] being viſible and notorious to all, was no Myſtery at all, nor can he be ſuppoſed to refer to that, when he tells them he would diſcover a Myſtery to them; for in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſe a Myſtery contains ſomewhat ſacred, and ſomewhat ſecret: But 'twas a great Myſtery and a marvellous Secret, that the body and bulk of the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſuffer'd by Gods juſt judgment to lye in unbelief till the fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was come in, and that then the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould all be called, the Vail taken off their faces, and ſo all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be ſaved; and this he ſays expreſly is God's Covenant unto them when he ſhall take away their ſins. By all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 'tis paſt all denial he means the <hi>Jews;</hi> for in the preceding Verſe he ſays, Blindneſs was happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in part, until the fulneſs of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:59586:72"/>ſhould come in, and then all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be ſaved, where the oppoſition is plain enough between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile;</hi> and he means the ſame thing by <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where he ſpeaks of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in part, and all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Quotation he brings ſolely reſpects the <hi>Jews, There ſhall come out of Sion the deliverer, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from Jacob.</hi> No Man can ever ſo miſtake, as to think that Propheſie belong'd to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or any part of them; <hi>For this</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant unto them; and as concerning the goſpel, they are enemies for your ſakes; but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers ſakes, for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</hi> So that this calling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that, according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is yet to come, for there has never been ſince his time, any ſuch juncture, with reference to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as could be called their fulneſs, or ſuch a revival, and ſuch a reception of them into the Chriſtian Church, as could be called Life from the Dead, or has it yet ſo turned unto the Lord, that the Vail has been taken off them; this calling, I ſay, of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ought to be eſtabliſhed as an undoubted Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Chriſtian Church, St. <hi>Paul</hi> having not in very many Points declared himſelf more fully, as I conceive, than he has done in this; nor is there any thing material that can poſſibly be objected againſt this genuine and clear In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Apoſtle's ſenſe before given, who has largely and with great exactneſs and accuracy treated upon this Subject, and as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for ever determined it.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:59586:72"/>
               <p>I come in the laſt place to the conſideration of this particular appartment of this Epiſtle in the 12th Chapter, from the 18th Verſe to the 24th. The Apoſtle in theſe Verſes is vigorouſly purſuing the chief deſign of this whole Epiſtle, which is to encourage and perſwade the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Jews,</hi> to ſtand faſt in the profeſſion of the Goſpel; and in order to it, not to forſake the Chriſtian Affemblies, [which was in thoſe days uſually the firſt ſtep to Apoſtaſie] notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the ſpecious Allurements they had to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Inſtitutions, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the ſore and preſſing Perſecutions they underwent for their Profeſſions ſake; and the chief Motives he inſiſts on all along for their ſo doing, are from the Author of the Goſpel, and the Excellency of the Goſpel it ſelf, the Preference it hath to the Law, the great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges they are arrived at thereby, and how worthy the Goſpel was in all reſpects to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd for. In theſe Verſes he ſeems to make an epitomizing compariſon between both the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations, that of the Law, and this of the Goſpel, and as he ſays in the 8th Chapter, ſpeaking of the Prieſthood of Chriſt, <hi>Of the things which we have ſpoken, this is the ſum,</hi> or head, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So what he ſays here in theſe Verſes ſeems to be ſuch a recapitulation of his whole comparative Diſcourſe between the Law and the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The particular induction of theſe Verſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in the 15th Verſe: <hi>Looking diligently, leſt any man fail [or fall away] from the grace of God; leſt any root of bitterneſs ſpring up, trouble you, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59586:73"/>thereby many be defiled: leſt there be any fornicator, or profane perſon, like Eſau, who for one morſel of meat ſold his birthright. For ye know how that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when he would have inherited the bleſſing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he ſought it carefully with tears;</hi> Which is in other words to ſay, take great heed leaſt any of you Apoſtatize from the Chriſtian Doctrine to <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> and that by ſuch example many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be ſeduced to do the like: For in ſo doing you will reſemble profane <hi>Eſau,</hi> who ſo eaſily as upon the preſſure of a little temporary hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the relief of one poor meal, ſold his birthright and primogeniture, upon which God had entailed the Prieſthood and the Dominion of the Family, the double portion, and the bleſſing of the Covenant, for ſo long as God was ſerved within private walls, and before the Tabernacle and Temple were erected, to the firſt born was appurtenant the Prieſthood, and the right of performing all Holy and ſacred Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations before the Lord; and upon theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the Apoſtle calls him Profane <hi>Eſau:</hi> the apoſtatizing <hi>Jews</hi> would reſemble him, and that in a twofold reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1st, Becauſe the Goſpel that contained all the glorious priviledges, was their peculiar birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, the promiſes being made originally, as we are told in the 9th of the <hi>Romans;</hi> to them, Chriſt came of them, and firſt offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them, and the Goſpel was preached in the firſt place to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and tender'd to them as their particular Right, before it reached the Gentiles.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:59586:73"/>
               <p n="2">2dly. If out of the impatience of ſome Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary perſecution and to obtain ſome preſent worldly eaſe and repoſe, they ſhould quit and forſake the Goſpel, they would become like prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> who deſpiſed all his Spiritual Priviledges, to ſatisfie his preſent appetite, and ſold them for ſo mean a carnal advantage as one poor meal.</p>
               <p>Before we come to a diſtinct conſideration of each particular of the Apoſtles compariſon, and for the clearer underſtanding of it, ſome things may be previouſly noted; Firſt, We have here ſet forth, how much more Honourable the call of a Chriſtian is then that of a <hi>Jew,</hi> and how much greater and nobler attainments we arrive at by the Goſpel, then ever the <hi>Jews</hi> could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to by the Law: And this is done, Firſt, Negatively, By ſhewing that we are paſt and not come to thoſe lower and more terrene Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations and Methods of the Law; but we are come to all the wonderful priviledges and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the Goſpel, it has been God's way from the Beginning to proceed gradually in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration of his love and good will to the World, and ſtill to advance farther and farther in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of himſelf, and in methods of Grace, till at laſt the intercourſe between God and Man upon the aſſumption of the Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Divine, is as near as it can be, and Men come to have acceſs to God, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. ver. 18. <hi>For through him we both have an acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father;</hi> which is to Worſhip in the Grace, Glory, and Efficacy of the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59586:74"/>and to have as much Communion and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with each Perſon diſtinctly, and as much enjoyment of them, as we are capable of in this lower World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle here ſets before the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> the form of giving the Law, and the effects of it, both which had in them all the diſcouragement and diſſwaſive imaginable from deſerting the Goſpel and returning to that; for the giving forth of the Law was with all the amazing affrighting Terrour that poſſibly could be, to repreſent the eternal Majeſty and Soveraignty of God the Supream Legiſlator: The dreadful Conſequences of breaking his Laws, and falling under his Juſtice and Wrath, and how fearful a thing it is for a ſinner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome reconciliation to fall into the Hands of the living God, and the effect of this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful promulgation was ſuitable to it, for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fell under the Higheſt conſternation, and petitioned that God would pleaſe to ſpeak for the future to them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> being far unable to endure any ſuch perſonal converſe with the Almighty: Nay, even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, that had ſo long, and ſo intimately converſed with God, was not able to abide by this dreadful appearance, but fell into a paroxiſm of quaking and fear, and this ſufficiently repreſented by the vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance there was between God and Man, in this diſpenſation, and how impoſſible it was for Man under that Law, ever to approach unto God with any comfort and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By the Apoſtles ſo punctually ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59586:74"/>forth the giving of the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and oppoſing that fingly, to the Fabrick and State of the Goſpel, is contained this inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, that it was comprehenſive of their whole conſtitution; the higheſt Priviledge and Honour the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church had to boaſt of, and that wherein they did moſt eminently ſtand diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the World, was, their being brought unto Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and God Perſonally meeting them there, and himſelf delivering his Law unto them: By this they were moſt eminently in their publick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional State taken into Covenant with God above all the kindreds of the Earth, and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted there by a political State and a National Church unto himſelf; and the Apoſtle reckons it as one of their higheſt priviledges, <hi>the giving of the Law.</hi> Now the force of the Apoſtles Diſcourſe lies in this, the greateſt thing you have to boaſt is your Law, and God's giving it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to you upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> thence came all your National Priviledges, and that was indeed no other then a ſplendid Miniſtration of Death, Man ſtood there before God under the greateſt Guilt, Condemnation and Miſery, and God ap peared with the ſevereſt and moſt awful aſpect that Man could behold him in; nothing but Thunders, Earthquakes, Voices, Fires, and dreadful Horror round about him: The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, the Peace, the Reconciliation, the near Approach unto God that Man ſtood in need of, theſe things belong to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> to which we are come by the Goſpel, and 'tis a very ſorry change for any <hi>Jew</hi> that had embraced the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59586:75"/>Chriſtian profeſſion and viewed the Glory of this ſpiritual Mount, and the Inhabitants of it to return back to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and all the dreadful circumſtances appurtenant to it.</p>
               <p>I come now to the diſtinct conſideration of each particular in theſe verſes, <hi>For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire,</hi> or as ſome better read it <hi>[the fire that burned;]</hi> the Apoſtle's ſcope is to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Excellency and Glory of the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate by a Negative compariſon of it with that of the Legal, and 'tis one good ſtep towards the ſhewing what a thing is, to ſhew compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively [when the compariſons lie near] what it is not, you are not come (ſays he) <hi>unto that mount that might be touched;</hi> coming to that Mount which your Fathers came to, is quite out of date; that is not your preſent buſineſs, that is not the Diſpenſation God calls you to now; but you are by his call come to another Mount, a much nobler and better ſtate of things, we are ſaid to be come to that to which God calls us unto, and to which he requires our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and obedience; the People came to this Mount after very great preparatives of God's own appointment; we by the Goſpel came to Mount <hi>Sion</hi> without any ſuch typical preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; this Mount was Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Horeb,</hi> called ſometimes the Mount of God, which probably St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he travelled there (as in one of his Epiſtles he tells us he did) had ſeen. Three things are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable of it, 1st, It was a very great and high Mountain. 2dly, That it was in a vaſt and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59586:75"/>Deſert, had a moſt retired and ſolitary Situation: And, 3dly, That it was a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain full of fruitleſs unprofitable Shrubs and Buſhes, from whence it had its denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Now in regard that all God's proceedings are originated in infinite Wiſdom, and ſo perfect and compleat, and every circumſtance of them carries in its bowels wonderful Inſtruction, 'tis not only our Duty, but our great Advantage and Intereſt by ſearching to find it out, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in things of this nature, where every thing was impregnated with future and typical ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, God's chuſing to appear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Law from the top of ſuch a Mountain, was to ſet before the People his Highneſs and Majeſty, and to repreſent his ſupreme Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over them, and the great diſtance that by this diſpenſation he was at from them; we read in Scripture of many ſacred Tranſactions upon Mountains, as being nearer Heaven and more removed from Earth; and our Saviour himſelf from ſuch a Pulpit uttered that famous Sermon of his recorded in the 5th of <hi>Matthew.</hi> God's Appearances to the World from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning have been ſuted to his Deſigns and Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereby; ſo when he appeared to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to give him the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiab,</hi> he appear'd in the form of a Man; when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to inſure him the People ſhould ſurvive their Afflictions and Sorrows in <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe his preſence was amongſt them, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as Fire in a Buſh, and the Buſh not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59586:76"/>by the Fire, becauſe he dwelt in it; and when he appeared to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who was to be his Captain, and ſight his Battels in <hi>Canaan,</hi> he appeared as an armed Man, with a naked Sword in his hand; ſo here, being to deliver, as the ſupreme Legiſlator, his Laws to the People, his Appearance is all Majeſtick, to repreſent the Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ctity and Severity of his Laws, and the dreadful deſtruction would accompany the breach of them: For let us but conſider di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and particularly how this Mount was circumſtanced, and we ſhall ſee nothing could to fleſh and blood be more awing and dreadful, the Lord himſelf, the eternal <hi>Jehovah,</hi> deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like devouring Fire upon it, the Mount was thereupon all over Fire and Smoak, with Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Darkneſs, and quaked exceedingly, Thunders and terrible Voices filled the Air, and above all, there ſounded in their cars that moſt dreadful ſound of the Trumpet, that waxed louder and Iouder, and the voice of words, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, with which they were ſo terrified, that they could not endure the conſternation of it, and earneſtly petitioned they might never hear it more. And what could be leſs expected, ſince this was the firſt general diſcovery, in a way judicial, God made to the World of their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie and Rebellion, and the firſt time he by a comprehenſive Law ſet it before them? We could not expect to hear of God in any other way, or that he would with any other aſpect ſhew himſelf upon ſuch an occaſion; the Law belonged to Man from the beginning, and was ſo imprinted in his conſtitution, that he was a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59586:76"/>Law to himſelf; it was alſo correſpondent to, and inherent in, the holy nature of God, that made him in his Image, but God thought it not fit to promulgate it in ſuch a Syſteme till now, nor to ſet before him in Tables of Stone, what was originally written, however defaced in the fleſhly Table of the Heart; but herein, as in a Glaſs, he ſhews unto Man at once his deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and apoſtate Face, and all the Rebellions of <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity ever ſince; the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of which muſt needs be dreadful to Man, and accompanied with the higheſt diſpleaſure in God; and therefore nothing was viſible in this whole Tranſaction, but Tokens of Wrath and Diſpleaſure; in a way judicial, nothing could more awfully repreſent. God's coming, to take a ſtrict Account of, and give a final <hi>Judgment upon the World,</hi> than this Appearance; the ſweet and gentle Calls of the Goſpel (ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction being interpoſed) are quite of another nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Mountain was ſcituated in a vaſt barren and fruitleſs Deſert, to ſignifie to us, the Nature of the Diſpenſation (as to Man's advantage by it) as barren and fruitleſs as the Deſert it ſelf, the Law being ſutable to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nature of God, and Man's corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Nature and Inclination lying in direct oppoſition to it, nothing but ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction could accrue unto Mankind thereby, the Law being, according to the Divine Nature, holy, juſt, and good, and Man being original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made in that Image, this Law before his fall would have been his great delight and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59586:77"/>and it had been natural to him to have lived in conformity to it, but having degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from that Image and loſt it, this Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes to him Death and Condemnation, God could not repeal it, nor Man perform the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it, nor make any ſutable ſatisfaction for his diſobedience, and ſo Mankind muſt needs lye down in ſorrow, and by the fear and dread of this Law be all their life-time ſubject to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; how impoſſible was unſinning obedience to a creature, the thoughts of whoſe heart was evil, and only evil, and continually evil? God could not repeal it, he could no more diſſolve and deſtroy or contradict that Law, as to the matter of it, than he could contradict his own Exiſtence; as for inſtance, when he commands no other Gods to be worſhipped but himſelf alone, this could never be repealed without God's denying himſelf; and ſo when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that Men ſhould not Steal, nor Lie: this is ſo founded in the rectitude, veracity, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, that it can never be reverſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are eternal Principles inherent in the Nature and Being of God, as well as the counterpart of Man's original Frame: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of this matter is plainly this, As no Man could poſſibly be happy, while in Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Maker, and in ſome reſpect againſt himſelf, ſo no Man could ever be happy under this Law, that fully diſcovered his Rebellion unto him, and inflicted the Penalties due to it, without any proviſion of Relief, or the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of any Remedy or Help in this caſe; Man could never keep this Law, nor make any
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59586:77"/>adequate compenſation for the breach of it, and therefore it only ſerved to make this diſcovery to him, that thereby he was irrecoverably loſt, and that his happineſs and help muſt ariſe ſome other way. So that of all places this Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai</hi> yields the leaſt deſirable Fruit to Mankind, and is of all others the moſt formidable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, and no Man that is once diſcharged from the dreadful conſequences that attend it, could ever more miſtake his own intereſt, than to meditate a retreat to the Soil of <hi>Horeb</hi> and <hi>Sinai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be asked, how we come ever to be freed from the Obligation of the Law, if the Law be in it ſelf of ſuch an unalterable Nature; the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, We never were, nor can be, free from an obligation to the matter of it, while the World endures there will be an obedience due to it; but our freedom and diſcharge from it lyes in this, there being no Remedy provided by the Law it ſelf for our breach of it, and Man himſelf being utterly at a loſs in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and never able to provide any, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the deepeſt profoundeſt contrivance of infinite Wiſdom, finds out a way to make a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction on our behalf to himſelf, for all our tranſgreſſions of it; and ſo although the Law, as to the nature of it, be not thereupon repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet upon plenary ſatisfaction made, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty is relaxed, and our bleſſed Redeemer in his own Perſon having ſuffered all the Penalties the Law inflicted, the whole power of legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and giving Laws to the World, is hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward put into his hand, all Power in Heaven
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59586:78"/>and Earth henceforth is his, the Mediator is now the only Legiſlator, and no Law is in force, but what he promulgeth; and thereupon as it was delivered upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> 'tis by him diſſolved, and we come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obligation to it, not only as it is the Law Natural, but by vertue of a new edition of it in the Laws of the Goſpel, with which it is incorporated and now enjoyned, and becomes obligatory upon the gracious terms thereof and no other.</p>
               <p>The third circumſtance conſiderable, with reference to this Mount, is this, That it was not only ſcituated in the barren Wilderneſs of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb,</hi> and was it ſelf a moſt barren fruitleſs place, full of nothing but unprofitable Shrubs, fit only for the fire, but it was alſo a Place of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful retreat from all the Buſineſs and Company of the World, a Place extreamly ſolitary and retired, in the midſt of a vaſt and uninhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Wilderneſs, and to this day remains the moſt deſolate part of the known World; here it was God was pleaſed to call the People out to meet him; here he choſe, of all the parts of the Earth, to deliver his Law to them, and not without great expreſſion and ſignification.</p>
               <p n="1">1st, This was to let us know, that when God ſpeaks to us, we ſhould have nothing to do, but ſingly to attend him; that ſuperſedes all other occaſions, is of greateſt import, and all other affairs are to be poſtpon'd. God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great things to tranſact with the People that came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in order to ſundry future as well as preſent deſigns of higheſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59586:78"/>and conſequence, kept them Forty Years in the Wilderneſs at his own finding and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that ſo nothing might interpoſe between him and them, nor interrupt that converſe he deſigned to have with them, and that tryal he meant to make of them: when we are to deal and tranſact with God, we ſhould ſay to all the World as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to his Servants when he was aſcending the Mount to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaac, Stay you here, while I go and worſhip yonder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2dly, This was to ſignifie to us, that when God powerfully declares himſelf in the efficacy of his Law, he will bring Men into ſuch a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as that no diverſions whatever ſhall relieve them, he will ſet them nakedly before him without the leaſt ſhelter to cover or conceal them; many are the coverings Men make to conceal themſelves and their nakedneſs from God, and many the ſubterfuges to which they retire from him, but one time or other God will have every living Man removed from all worldly concerns to make his Appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; he will call every Family and every Perſon apart, and ſet their ſins in order before them, after they have accuſtomed themſelves to ſuch mean and low conceptions of him, that at laſt they think him to be like themſelves, and thereby render the Notion of God nothing but an Idol in their own degenerate fancy. God's chuſing this place to deliver his Law, ought to be a great and awful conſideration to every Man that makes it his buſineſs to hide himſelf by diverſion from God, and the beſt part of himſelf, which is his Conſcience, the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59586:79"/>great preſent Relief that both evil Men and evil Angels find, is by diverting themſelves with the Noiſe and Buſineſs of this World, from a ſolemn conſideration of the relation there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and them, and how great an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptant every creature muſt needs be to his Maker, ill Men would ſoon fall into great Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, was there nothing in their view but God and themſelves, for they carry about with them their own condemnation: 'Twas truly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſaid by a Heathen Author, <hi>Prima est haec ultio quod ſe judice Nemo nocens abſolvitur.</hi> Every ſuch Man is in Practicals, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us an Heretick is in Doctrinals, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Man condemned of himſelf; and 'tis impoſſible to diſcharge ſuch a Man. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle, I take to be, that he that had at his firſt entrance into Chriſtianity, that had at his Baptiſm made a publick Profeſſion of the true orthodox Doctrine of the Goſpel, and after fallen in with corrupt and heretical Opinions contrary to it, had thereby openly condemned himſelf, and pulled down what he before had built up: So 'tis with all Men that profeſs to know God, and in Works deny him; that are convinced of the Law, that it is good, and of the obligation they have to it, but yet never meaſure their own Practices by it; ſooner or later they will be all brought into the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances the People were in at this Mount <hi>Sinai; David</hi> diverted himſelf long from the ſenſe of his Murder and Adultry, but at laſt God ſingled him out, and ſo treated with him apart from all the concerns of his Kingdom, as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59586:79"/>filled him with the deepeſt Anguiſh and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. How wiſe and happy a choice is it to enter into our Cloſets betimes, to commune with our own Hearts and be ſtill, and to let our Reins inſtruct us in the ſtill Seaſon of the Night, to ſet God before us, and all the World at a diſtance behind us, and take a right and perfect view of our own ſtate with reference to God, and never take up our reſt till we are arrived to thoſe Terms he requires to qualifie us for our reconciliation to him, that we may upon good grounds reckon our ſelves amongſt the Called, the Faithful, and the Choſen. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel there is one ſure never-failing tryal of a ſafe condition, he that ſincerely and as an honeſt Man ought to do a thing, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours a perfect conqueſt over his moſt prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and predominant Sin, that Man is a ſincere Man in the Goſpel account, and without all controverſie in the high road to Everlaſting Happineſs; 'tis our great wiſdom to poſſeſs our ſelves now with thoſe thoughts we ſhall be ſure to have when God ſummons us to make our Appearance before him; whatever it is that keeps us from ſo doing, engages us to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt folly, and renders a Man the Scripture-Fool, that is, the Fool in God's account, which is the true Fool, a Man made up and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of folly about his greateſt concerns; when the mirth and pleaſant part of the World is a diverſion from this, we may well ſay of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that it is Madneſs, and when we employ our ſelves in the wiſeſt and moſt ſerious part of the World, in order to ſecure us from this,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59586:80"/>we do but ſeed upon Vanity and Lies, a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Heart leads us aſide, and we cover our ſelves with ſuch a ſorry garment as will ſhortly be ſtript from us, and we ſhall be left expoſed and naked; how great and how miſerable a Fool is that Man that is top full of this World, and the Buſineſs of it, and thinks of nothing elſe, when God calls him privately aſide, and tells him, <hi>This night ſhall thy ſoul be taken from thee;</hi> and from henceforward, to all eternity, thou ſhalt have nothing to do but to converſe with thy own Sins and with me in the effects of my Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Several appurtenant Circumſtances the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle reckons up to this Mount, to which they were not come, which they might contemplate with much ſatisfaction, and the more highly value Goſpel-Attainments:</p>
               <p n="1">1st, That it might be touched; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which was only this, that the intangibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it by Man or Beaſt, was only by vertue of Divine Sanction and Command, and ſo it was but figuratively ſo; but the Mount in it ſelf might be touched, and was a carnal earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing ſutable to that diſpenſation, which was but an earthly Tabernacle pitch'd by Man; but Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> he compares it withal, is a thing impoſſible to be touched, and is in its own nature purely ſpiritual; the ſum is, your Fathers came with their Bodies to a Mount that might be touched, though it muſt not be touched; but by the Goſpel, you are come in your Spirits to a Mount that cannot corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be touched, that is altogether heavenly and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59586:80"/>2dly, It was full of Fire. 3dly, There was Blackneſs. 4thly, Darkneſs: And, 5thly, Tempeſts. Fire is of all parts of the Creation moſt dreadful to fleſh and blood, and in it ſelf terrifying, tormenting, devouring; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to make his Majeſty the more dreadful, God 'tis ſaid deſcended upon the Mount in Fire, and the Law here given is thence called a fiery Law; in the 5th of <hi>Deut.</hi> we find the People three times together expreſſing their dreadful fear of this Fire; and the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to this in the 97th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> when he ſays, <hi>A fire goeth before him.</hi> As the moſt dreadful part of the Creation, Hell it ſelf is ofteneſt ſet forth by it; this Fire was accompanied with Blackneſs, Darkneſs, Tempeſt, Lightnings, Thundrings, and Earthquakes, the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting aſtoniſhing Compoſition that could be ſet before Humane Eyes, and in that conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction rendring each other more terrifying and amazing, all repreſenting the obſcurity and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of that Diſpenſation, and the ſad and ſore Puniſhments the Law inflicted upon every tranſgreſſor; as Hell is called Fire, ſo 'tis alſo called the Blackneſs of Darkneſs; and by the Tempeſt, was ſignified what Storms and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the Law makes in the Minds of convinced Sinners, when no Remedy appears. 'Tis not now poſſible to conceive, what a terrifying, heart-breaking, killing Sight, that Mount was ſo circumſtanced, and the Apoſtle gives them no ſmall ground of conſolation, when he tells them they are not come to this Mount: 'Tis true, that all this is called by the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59586:81"/>in the New Teſtament, Glorious, but 'tis meant of the Glory of God's Juſtice and of his ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which we are told is much excelled, and in a ſort eclipſed by the Glory of his Grace and Mercy.</p>
               <p n="6">6thly, and 7thly. To compleat the Terrour of this Mount the Apoſtle mentions the ſound of the Trumpet, by which God ſummoned the People to appear before Him, and the <hi>voice of words which the people were not able to bear the hearing of:</hi> Of the ſacred uſe of Trumpets we read much in Scripture, ſometimes to ſummon to great Judgments, and ſometimes preparative calls to great Mercies, they were uſed in calling Aſſemblies, and in a ſolemn manner in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the Jubile every 50th Year; upon which account the People were ſaid to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that heard the <hi>joyful ſound:</hi> There was alſo every firſt Day of the 7th Month, a Memorial of blowing of Trumpets to ſummon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Day of expiation, the preaching of the Goſpel is often typically repreſented, by a Trumpet ſounding, 'tis alſo in the Revelation, introductive of all the great Judgments towards the end of the World, the ſeven Trumpets there are ſaid to ſound for that purpoſe; and in the very laſt coming of Chriſt, he is ſaid to come with the Voice of the Arch-Angel and the Trumpet of God: This that the People heard here was not a real Trumpet, but the ſound of one, poſſibly the Voice of the Arch-Angel ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the ſound of a Trumpet, as perhaps the Voice of the Arch-Angel and the Trumpet of God when Chriſt ſhall come, is only the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59586:81"/>Voice of the Arch-Angel utter'd in the ſound of a Trumpet, this Trumpet upon Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai</hi> is ſaid to wax louder and louder; ſignifying God's nearer approach until he uttered the Law unto them: The ſound of it was moſt terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dreadful, and had this ſignification, That God will call all Fleſh before him and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum them to receive the Judgment pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his Laws, and the call will be ſo loud that no Mortal Ear can exclude it.</p>
               <p>To the ſound of the Trumpet is added the <hi>voice of words,</hi> with which the People were ſo greatly affrighted, their fear aroſe not only from the Matter of the Words, but from the manner of their delivery, and that dreadful ſound in which they were uttered, as appears by their petition put up, which was not that God ſhould not ſpeak to them any more, but that he would ſpeak by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and not himſelf perſonally any more leaſt they ſhould die. This appears in the recapitulation of this ſtory in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. the People are there ſaid to deſire <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay.</hi> The Apoſtle adds, they could not bear that which was commanded, the weight of the Law was unſupportable; and to add to the terror of all Diſobedience to it, if ſo much as Man or Beaſt touched the Mountain from whence it was delivered it was immediately to die; and even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf who had often been ſo near unto God, and ſo converſant with him, was not able to abide this dreadful ſcene, but fell into conſternation and horror, [an evident intimation, that the beſt Man upon Earth could
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59586:82"/>not ſtand before God, under that diſpenſation;] which addition to the ſtory, God for ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial ends (we may be aſſured) gave to the Apoſtle by Revelation, there being no ſuch thing recorded by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>In the 22th Verſe the Apoſtle comes to the ſecond Part of the compariſon, the affirmitive Part, ſhewing what it is that the believing <hi>Jews</hi> when they embraced Chriſtianity came to, <hi>but ye are come to mount Sion:</hi> 1st, This in general is to inſtruct the converted <hi>Jews,</hi> that by the Goſpel they are come to, and embodyed with the true Catholick Church, called in ſcripture, the fulneſs of him that filleth all things; of which the National Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was but a Type and a Figure: 2dly, That this true Catholick Church is partly in Heaven and partly on Earth. And 3dly, The Apoſtle by intermixing theſe parts together in his account of them, gives them to underſtand, that they are all of one piece and together make but one Church and one Body under one Head, things in Heaven and things on Earth being united in Chriſt as their common head, and by telling them they are <hi>come,</hi> they are come to this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church: the Apoſtle ſignifies this unto them, that as their Fathers after ſeveral Days Travel upon their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by great and ſolemn preparations, came at laſt to Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> ſo they and their Fathers hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing travelled through the former diſpenſation, which was the great preparative to this, they are now ſafely arrived hither, and are come to all the Glories and Priviledges of the Goſpel,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59586:82"/>they are come in reſpect of Relation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to all that part of the Church that is in Heaven, and to all the true and real parts of it upon Earth, not now confin'd to any National Conſtitution whatever; and this is the beſt ſtate and utmoſt that we can attain to in this World. The Apoſtles drift here is not at all to deſcribe the Church Triumphant, but the Militant Church; the force of this Diſcourſe lies in preferring the ſtate of the Goſpel Church here upon Earth, beyond and before that of the legal and judicial Church, and the Apoſtle chooſeth to repreſent them both by two Mounts, one where the Law was given, (which was the greateſt thing belonged to the Judaical oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy;) and the other from whence the Goſpel firſt iſſued. If you ask why the Apoſtle repreſents the Goſpel ſtate by Mount <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that were places proper and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to the <hi>Jews;</hi> there are ſeveral accounts may be given of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1st, Becauſe thoſe places had Spiritual and Goſpel ſignifications even as the <hi>Jews</hi> enjoy'd them; and ſo the Apoſtle repreſents by them [the better to engage the <hi>Jews</hi>] what they tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and really ſignified, and ſpeaks of them in their own native and proper repreſentation: Mount <hi>Sion</hi> conſiſted of two parts, on the higheſt part the Temple was built, and on the other the Palace of their Kings; ſo that this Mount was typically comprehenſive of their Civil and Eccleſiaſtical ſtate.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:59586:83"/>
               <p n="2">2dly, The Goſpel firſt iſſued from thence, and it was propheſied that ſo it ſhould do, <hi>Eſau</hi> 2.3. <hi>out of Sion ſhall go forth the Law,</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel) <hi>and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem.</hi> And the ſame Prophet tells us, <hi>the deliverer ſhall come out of Sion;</hi> and upon that account in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. God is ſaid <hi>from Mount Sion to command the bleſſing, even life for evermore;</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, Chriſt himſelf came into the Temple upon Mount <hi>Sion</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and from thence in perſon iſſued out the Proclamation of the Goſpel, and therefore the Apoſtle keeps up the Honour of this Mount, and this City, becauſe it had ever been by right and deſignation the ſeat of the true Worſhip of the only true God, in oppoſition to all Idolatry, and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count called the City of the Living God; and in regard of the moſt glorious Types and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurations were therein included, and at laſt therein appeared the great end and ſubſtance of them all; the glorious Perſon of God-Man of Chriſt himſelf; it ſeems in a ſort neceſſary, if the Church were denominated by any one place; it ſhould be from this, as being compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of the whole Church and State of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the very center of it, the Catholick Church under the Goſpel being under confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to no one place more then another, no one place could ſo give a denomination to it, as it might do to a National Church, and therefore this place is made choice of by the Holy Ghoſt, and being comprehenſive of all God's ſacred inſtitutions of old, of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, and the Goſpel Church Spiritually:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59586:83"/>The Catholick Church univerſally thereupon is denominated from it, and by it, to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>To which we may add in the Third place, That ſince all the promiſes in the Old Teſtament that are made to the Goſpel Church to the end of the World, are made to it under thoſe names of <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that therefore it ſeems neceſſary to keep up thoſe names [as it hath pleaſed the Holy Ghoſt to do] to the end of the World, to ſhew the punctual fulfilling of thoſe promiſes in all Ages. What Mount <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſignified will not be compleated till the Conſummation of all things, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count God was ſaid to take up his reſt and dwell there for ever: Nothing therefore ſeems ſo proper, ſo decent, and fit, as to denominate the Goſpel-Church by thoſe terms; and as it was in the Apoſtles times a great help to them to find out what Chriſt was to do and ſuffer, by what was ſignified and typified of him under the Law, ſo it will be to the very end of the World a marvellous help to the Church to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the glorious methods of his Kingdom and Government, by looking back and ſeeing how it was ſet forth in the prefigurations of it that belonged to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and Mount <hi>Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It pleaſeth the Holy Ghoſt throughout the whole Scripture moſt frequently to repreſent the Goſpel in Judaical Types and Phraſes, and two reaſons we may probably ſuppoſe for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1st, To ſhew what an exact Agreement and Harmony there is in all God's Diſpenſations,

               <p>And 2dly, As a means to promote the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the latter times, when they ſhall lay to heart and conſider, that all their own Religion expreſſed in their own Language, is truly and fully to be found in the Chriſtian Religion, that the Law therein is exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd into the Goſpel, and every particular thing they moſt valued they ſhall here find by name expreſſed, and fully to be enjoyed in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and perfection of it.</p>
               <p>But for the more punctual and exact diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Apoſtles ſenſe in theſe Verſes, it will be needful to conſider the particulars [to which he tells the believing <hi>Jews</hi> they were come] ſeverally, and diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>The Firſt thing he tells them they are come to, is to <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> of which for the clearer comprehenſion of the Apoſtles meaning by it, ſome things may be particularly conſidered of that Mount as it ſtood circumſtanced under the Law; and this in eſpecial, that the great Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our that is put upon it in Scripture, is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally with reſpect to the Temple that then ſtood upon the top of it, and which was meant and ſignified by it; this was the place whither all the Males were to come three times a Year, and the ſolemn part of all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Worſhip could be no where elſe performed, and their private Worſhip where ever they were at home or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, (upon <hi>Solomon</hi>'s requeſt to God at the firſt dedication of it) was generally directed
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59586:84"/>towards this place. This we may ſee in the caſe of <hi>Jonah,</hi> who in the Whale's Belly thought of directing his Prayer towards this Holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> when it was pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down and lay in Rubbiſh, prayed even then towards it three times a day, as we ſee in the 6th of <hi>Daniel.</hi> This Temple, placed upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> was the only ſanctified Houſe where the mighty God was pleaſed to take up his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſince the World began; the Tabernacle was ſmall and ambulatory, and but preparative to this glorious, ſanctified, ſolemn Fabrick; the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> were only holy relatively and upon collateral accounts, the City with reference to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the place of God's reſidence, but the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was inherently Holy, made ſo by God's own dedication, and deſcent into it at the firſt; this was the place where day and night God was ſerved without ceaſing, according to his own ordination, and therefore he is ſaid to love it above all the <hi>dwelling places of Jacob.</hi> Here the long expected Meſſiah, the Son of God, Chriſt himſelf was brought, and all that the Law required performed about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Houſe: But ſure we are the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended nothing literal about this Mount, his drift is wholly ſpiritual; and therefore, having premiſed thus much of the literal, typical State of this Mount, we muſt now examine what it means in this place, and as it lyes in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, and the ſenſe intended, ſeems very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; by Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the City of the living God, the ſame thing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59586:85"/>is intended and this is the meaning, ye are come to all that was typified by them, and all that was promiſed on the Churches behalf to them, to every Promiſe made to the Church under thoſe denominations, which is no other but the Goſpel-ſtate and the bleſſed Priviledges and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations thereof in its fulneſs and glory; the Apoſtle declares the meaning of theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be ſpiritual, and neither of private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation nor literal ſignification, that the <hi>Jews</hi> might ceaſe doting upon them in that low and mean ſenſe, and might be convinced that the Goſpel vertually contains all that was excellent in them; Mount <hi>Sion</hi> (as was before ſaid) had its value from the Temple that ſtood upon it, and therefore when the Goſpel is propheſied of by it, 'tis ſaid <hi>the mountain of the Lord's houſe ſhall be exalted on the top of the mountains.</hi> Now, inſtead of this material Temple, every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian under the Goſpel is himſelf a living Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Holy Ghoſt, a Temple wherein God dwells, and all ſpiritual Worſhip and Service is continually offered up, and the whole Church is one intire living Temple, wherein God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſpiritually ſerved, ſo 'tis expreſſed in the 2d of <hi>Epheſ. Now therefore ye are no more ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the ſaints and of the houſhold of God, and are built upon the foundation of the apoſtles and prophets, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner-ſtone, in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:</hi> And he that is arrived at this true Goſpel-ſtate, and all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Enjoyments of it, to have acceſs to the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59586:85"/>Father, through the Son, by that one Spirit, he is come to the true Mount <hi>Sion</hi> and the real Temple, where God will dwell for ever, he abides in the neareſt acceſs to God he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, and in all thoſe holy and ſanctified Qualifications which the Temple ſignified, as it was then the Seat and Center of all the true Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Jews</hi> they are come to, is the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the City of the living God, and although the ſignification of this, is the ſame with Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> yet it is greatly farthering to the Apoſtle's deſign, the mention of it, that ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> might think nothing valuable amongſt them was loſt, but all to be found with great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the profeſſion of the Goſpel, the whole Religion of that National Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> being contained in this City, and therein ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually compriſed the whole ſtate of the Goſpel. The Catholick Church, with great reaſon and ſignification, under the Goſpel every where ſpread, and under no confinement, is ſtiled a City, and is called <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> a vaſt difference there was between coming to that dreadful, barren Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb,</hi> and the City of the living God. Several things are conſiderable in this City to heighten the compariſon, taking it to be made either with Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> literal:</p>
               <p n="1">1st, The Noble and Honourable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this City: 'Tis governed by the great Charter of the Goſpel; none have any Rule but the living God himſelf; no Laws are in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59586:86"/>force here, but what come from Chriſt's own Mouth; the Goſpel Church is built up and managed as the Temple was [which was the ſoul and glory of this City] in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, by God's own punctual direction, and there is his delight; there his Soul reſts where he is ſerved by Laws of his own compoſing and enacting.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, This City is a place of invincible ſtrength and ſecurity; the <hi>Jews</hi> knew to their coſt the earthly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not ſo: here's the Mount <hi>Sion</hi> that cannot be moved; the Gates of Hell can never prevail againſt it; 'tis ſure to remain againſt all oppoſition, till it be ſafely taken up into Heaven, from whence it came.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, The Inhabitants of it are all united; 'tis a City compact together, not with carnal and earthly, but ſpiritual Ligaments; there is ſuch an union in it as God has choſen and takes pleaſure in; amidſt great variety, they have but one Head; they all miniſter under him as fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens for the good of each other; they are all guided and animated by one Spirit, and they all tend to one and the ſame end.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, 'Tis a City of wonderful Beauty, the City of the great King, the Palace of the living and eternal God, as the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſays compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſively and prophetically of it under the name of <hi>Sion, Beautiful for ſcituation is mount Sion, the joy of the whole earth:</hi> this Beauty lyes in the Preſence of God, and in its Sanctity, and in that Image and Superſcription of God that it bears; here are to be ſeen the Beauties
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59586:86"/>of Holineſs, and the Stamp of all the Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes: and this City, as it is called the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the City of the living God, is oppoſed to the earthly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as it abode during the whole ſtate of the Law; for we are told in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that that was in bondage with her Children as well as Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> but <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is above, ſays he is free, which is this heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> he here ſpeaks of; the Apoſtle means not by <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above, the Heavenly State, that is plain by the Context, but he means the State of the Goſpel-Church here upon Earth: the thing to be enquired after is, upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count 'tis called the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> above, and that we ſhall find to be a moſt proper and reaſonable Appellation of it, and that upon ſeveral accounts:</p>
               <p n="1">1st, It comes originally down from Heaven, Divine Revelation is the Ground and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, All the Inhabitants of Heaven dwell alſo here, both the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, by their gracious Preſence and Influences; and in that reſpect this is ſaid to be their Dwelling-place, and their Abode for ever; and therefore in the following words the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells them who the Inhabitants are of this Mount and City to which they are come, <hi>God, the Judge of all, Jeſus, the Mediator of the New Covenant, and an innumerable company of Angels;</hi> the Angels are all as miniſtring Spirits and Servants preſent in it and converſant about it, and ſuch Inhabitants muſt needs make an holy City.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:59586:87"/>
               <p n="3">3dly, It is made up of Members part in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and part on Earth, the bleſſed Angels, and the Saints departed, as well as the Saints living on Earth, are parts of it, and ſo it has a good Title to be called Heavenly, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, All the true Members of it, even upon Earth, are holy and heavenly Perſons, their converſation, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, their City-converſation is in Heaven, and they are all travelling towards their everlaſting reſt there. And ſo this Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is the Heavenly State of the Catholick Church under the Goſpel, which is not fixed to any one earthly place, nor can it be in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage or come under captivity, but is free, is the <hi>Mother of us all,</hi> comes from above, and returns thither; it may be ſaid of it as it was of Chriſt, when he was the <hi>Son of Man upon Earth,</hi> he was alſo the <hi>Son of Man in Heaven;</hi> and ſo this <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> this heavenly City, whil'ſt it is upon Earth, it is alſo in Heaven: the nature of it is purely ſpiritual and heavenly, and the whole World, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in it, making, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, of <hi>them twain one new man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third think Believers are ſaid to come to, is an <hi>innumerable company of Angels;</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is taken out of the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> where it is ſaid, ſpeaking of God, Thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands miniſter unto him, and Ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him, ye are come to Miriads of Angels, which is well ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, <hi>an innumerable company of Angels;</hi> and this is made good ſeveral ways:</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:59586:87"/>
               <p n="1">1ſt, We are come ſo to them as to be of the ſame Society and Family with them, they are part of Chriſt's Houſhold, only inhabit a Story above us; for by the Blood of his Croſs all things in Heaven and Earth are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in and under him as their Supreme Head and Soveraign, and make but one Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they all joyn together in the ſame Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Worſhip, for God hath ſaid, let all the Angels of God worſhip him, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves upon all occaſions to be fellow-ſervants with the Saints in all Chriſt's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, in all the Affairs of his Houſe and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, We are come to theſe Angels by having a ſecret, inviſible, yet conſtant and ſweet Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them; great is the inviſible influence the Angels have upon us, and the converſe they have with us, taking notice of all our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotions, and farthering us therein, by many unthought of and undiſcerned, yet very advantageous circumſtances, ſuch as lyes in their way to adminiſter, and alſo by being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the publick and ſolemn Aſſemblies of the Church, where they not only joyn and concur in the Worſhip and Service performed, but without all doubt in ſuch methods as are proper to them to operate in, they are aiding and aſſiſting, and both in the private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip of the Saints, continually prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and oppoſing the malignant endeavours of Satan and the other Angels; and ſo there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a ſweet Communion maintained between the Saints upon Earth and them in Heaven; as
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59586:88"/>the Saints here look upwards and rejoyce in their fix'd and eſtabliſh'd Happineſs and Glory above, ſo they are continually aſcending and deſcending and viſiting the Saints here below, and uſing all endeavours to bring them ſafe to the ſame bleſſed ſtate with themſelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the whole Trinity ſo employed as they are for Man's recovery, and taking ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in it, and they themſelves having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Orders in Heaven from their Supreme Soveraign and Head to that purpoſe, their whole Endeavours tend that way, and to aſſiſt in the compleating of the Church, as it is their peculiar Province, ſo it is alſo their great Delight and Satisfaction.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. We are come to thoſe Miriads of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as they are Chriſt's ſupreme inviſible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents and Officers in his Church, and to all the Advantages of their Service and Miniſtry, in general, they have the care of all the Elect, the whole Body of the Faithful are committed to their charge and keeping, we are told <hi>the Angels of the Lord encampeth about them that fear him,</hi> as they did about <hi>Eliſha</hi> of old. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious and wonderful Deliverances does Chriſt effect for his Church in general, and each individual Member of it, by the Angelical Miniſtry? the manner of which, though we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefit, is to us unknown; and as they were under the Old Teſtament employed to make extraordinary Revelations of the Will of God to the World, ſo they are now employed to be continually ſuggeſting the Mind and Will of God to the Hearts and Spirits of his choſen,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59586:88"/>and to counter-work the Devil in all his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Suggeſtions to the contrary; this is not done in ſuch a way as the holy Spirit ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, who is an indweller with us and cohabits with the Soul, but the Angels work upon us only as external Operators, and ſo what they do is by making impreſſions upon our Faculties from outward and external Means and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſuted thereunto, and from our preſent Inclination and Diſpoſition, ſutable to which they accommodate their Actings, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey not, as the Holy Ghoſt does, any inward Power of Acting, nor any new Abilities to our Souls.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, As the evil Angels are conſtant obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of all the Tranſactions of the Church in general, and of every Member of it in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, in order to accuſe, calumniate and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent before God, ſo theſe bleſſed Angels are conſtant Spectators and publick Notaries of all the Proceedings of the Church, and all the Actings and Sufferings of every Member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in order to bear a faithful Witneſs before God, and be a punctual Record thereof at the Day of Judgment: And in this ſenſe we are come unto them, they are not only preſent in publick Aſſemblies, but converſant in the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of every Saint, and take an exact view of all their devout and fervent Addreſſes unto God; upon this account it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that the Apoſtles by their Preaching and Suffering were a Spectacle to Angels, the holy Angels beheld their Spiritual Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt with wonderful ſatisfaction; and upon
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59586:89"/>this account it is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> before the Elect Angels, to look well to the diſcharge of his Work and Office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Witneſſes appointed of God to take punctual notice of his Behaviour therein; and the Preſence of the Angels is made an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument by the Holy Ghoſt for the well-order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves and all our Actions in Church-Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly, The Angels as they are God's Officers, employed for the guard and ſecurity of the Church, ſo they are alſo for the revenging of his Wrath upon their Enemies, ſo it often was under the Old Teſtament, and ſo it is under the New, and will continue till the end; that wretched prophane <hi>Herod,</hi> who added to all his former wickedneſs to ſhut up <hi>John</hi> in Priſon, and after added to that addition to cut off his Head to pleaſe a <hi>Dalilah,</hi> and at laſt came to make himſelf his own Idol, by taking to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that glory that ſhould have been aſcribed to God, at laſt an Angel ſmote him and diſpatch'd him to his own place, by a woful and miſerable Cataſtrophey: the Angels ſtood all ready when our bleſſed Saviour was led to the Croſs, to have reſcued him upon the leaſt Command; this our Saviour himſelf told the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he was encompaſs'd with a <hi>Roman</hi> Guard, he could upon requeſt to his Father have <hi>more then twelve legions of angels to reſcue and aſſist him,</hi> which exceeded the number of Men the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> then had in their whole Army, for their Army at that time did not conſiſt of twelve Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; and in the <hi>Revelations</hi> we find the Angels
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59586:89"/>conſtantly employed by God as the great Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of his Wrath upon the Churches Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the end of the World.</p>
               <p n="6">6thly, We are come to this innumerable company of Angels, as to our trueſt Friends and moſt faithful Companions, for they never leave us till they have brought us home.</p>
               <p n="1">1st, To the reſt of our Souls in Heaven, for they wait upon every dying Believer to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and chear his ſpirit ſo ſoon as ever it hath left the Body, and ſafely to convey it into that Bleſſed fellowſhip above, and into that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious place and ſtate of reſt called <hi>Abraham's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 2dly, They will be aſſiſting and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental [though it be effected by the mighty Power of God] to call and raiſe the Bodies of the Saints out of their Graves at laſt: when Chriſt comes to effect the firſt Reſurrection, he will be attended with all his Glorious Angels, and by their Miniſtry the Dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt, the Trumpet that will ſound to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon them out of their aſhes will be an Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſound, probably the Voice of the Arch-Angel; and when they ariſe out of the Earth, they will together with all the Saints then liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be caught up by the Angels and conveyed by them to meet the Lord in the Air, [the laſt office the Angels will have to perform,] and ſo will ever abide with him. Whoſe heart would not burn within him upon the contemplation of theſe things, that God ſhould be ſuch a lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Men, that the Eternal Son ſhould by his death redeem them; his own ſpirit by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59586:90"/>come down and dwell in them; and all the Angels in Heaven made their Guardians; and their whole Miniſtry and Service employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their behalf.</p>
               <p>How bleſſed a condition does the Goſpel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate us in above the Law, in reference to this particular: When Man firſt fell by ſin, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels became his moſt avowed Enemies, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners of Wrath, that went out againſt him; for the <hi>Cherubims</hi> ſtood with a flaming Sword to keep the Tree of Life, and to ſhut Man out of Paradiſe, he made his Angels Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and at that time <hi>his miniſters a flame of fire.</hi> When the Law was given upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and Man conſidered only in his natural ſtate, the Angels were moſt dreadful and terrible in their appearance; but now under the Goſpel, Angels and Men by the Blood of the Croſs are embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed into one Fellowſhip and Society, united in and under one head, engaged in the ſame Worſhip and Service, and enjoy a ſweet and moſt endeared communion each with other; all which is fully inſinuated and intimated by the Apoſtle in telling the Believing <hi>Jews</hi> they were <hi>come to this innumerable company of angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4thly, The Apoſtle tells them, they are come to the <hi>general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born which are written in Heaven:</hi> This is an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that part of the Catholick Church here upon Earth, to which by the Goſpel all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers come, and with which they are incorporat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and imbodyed; two things are intended here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to ſhew the preference of the Goſpel-ſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of the Legal.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:59586:90"/>
               <p n="1">1st, That inſtead of the Aſſembly of all the Males three times a Year at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is called in Scripture <hi>the great congregation,</hi> they are come now to the great Aſſembly of all the Members of the true Catholick Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Mankind, to all the true ſervants of God both of <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles, that any where call upon God in Spirit and Truth, and that God would have ſuch a general Aſſembly, and ſuch an univerſal Church of the firſt-born throughout all Nations, without any farther reſpect to the <hi>Jews</hi> or their Church, was a ſecret undiſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the Goſpel Revelation came.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, That this aſſembly conſiſts only of real and true Saints, ſuch as have the right of the firſt born: the great inheritance that men are born capable of in this World, is the poſſeſſion of Heaven at laſt; thoſe that obtain that are the eldeſt ſons of this lower World, and the firſt-born amongſt Mankind in the Scripture ſenſe; and none obtain this inheritance but ſuch as are eternally elected in Chriſt to it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle when he names the Church of the firſt-born, adds, as explanatory of it, <hi>whoſe names are inrolled in Heaven,</hi> that is in the Lamb's Book of Life, in the Roll of God's eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and councels, there they are Regiſtred, and not in an Earthly Regiſter as the <hi>Jews</hi> were; this Church of the firſt-born is called in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, the firſt fruits of the whole Creation, <hi>unto God and the Lamb;</hi> they are ſaid to be Heirs to God and Joynt-heirs with Chriſt; they are made Kings and Prieſts unto God, and ſo have all the Title and Right of Primogeniture appurtenant

This infinitely exceeds the ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> who were but a typical People; their general Aſſembly was but a national Aſſembly; and though many excellent particular Saints were amongſt them, yet they were in their National Conſtitution but a figure and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of this true Saintſhip, and the whole that belonged to them was but a ſhadow and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of this true Catholick Church, and not the thing it ſelf; they were enrolled indeed but it was upon Earth, and upon an Earthly account to preſerve their Tribes diſtinct, and ſo to adjuſt their Earthly inheritances in <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt difficulty that ſeems to be in this part of the Apoſtles Compariſon, is, what is meant by this expreſſion, <hi>the general aſſembly;</hi> ſince there neither was, nor ever will be, a time that all the Members of the Church under the Goſpel ſhall meet together till Chriſt's ſecond coming; the words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> here uſed, I take to ſignifie the ſame thing, and the latter to be exegetical of the former; 'tis not meant of the Church, of the firſt-born of all aſſembling in any one place, but of that Church every where aſſembling in ſeveral and diſtinct parts, 'tis ſpoken in oppoſition to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were but one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar nation aſſembling at one place in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to which they were confin'd; the generality the Apoſtle means, does not ariſe from their meeting all in one place, but from their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without confinement all the World over: to this general Aſſembly of the Goſpel-Church every Believer is come, and to it is united, but
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59586:92"/>'tis after a Spiritual manner, and therein lies the excellency of this Union; this Aſſembly where ever or in what parts ſoever they are met are animated by one Spirit; they have the ſame Faith and Hope, the ſame Priviledges and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and [wherein the Life of the Union lies] they are all united under one common Head, and are but one Body belonging to it, and ſo the ſenſe ſeems to be this, [which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it the force of the Apoſtles compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;] ye are not after an Earthly manner come with your Bodies to any ſuch aſſembly as that at mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> nor as that of the Males at the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but ye are come which is infinitely better, in your Souls and Spirits, unto the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and Fellowſhip of all the Sanctified and ſaved throughout the World, who now every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where Worſhip the Father in Spirit and Truth, and are all preſent together in one Spirit, though corporally divided, having but one common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, rejoycing in the welfare and proſperity of each other, and cloſely united in their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual prayers and concerns each for other.</p>
               <p>This is of all others the moſt truly Honourable and Noble Society that we can converſe with in this World, here the Bleſſing is commanded <hi>life for evermore:</hi> here's the Crown of all Mans glory and Happineſs to be obtained; he that is no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Aſſociation is under a black Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, and comes no farther then the Aſſembly of the fallen Angels and their Aſſociates: the Scripture informs us, that the Wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides upon every ſuch Man, and the Judge ſtands at the Door ſhortly to execute it; the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59586:93"/>foundation of this Glorious Happy and Bleſſed Aſſembly ſtands ſure, and this is the ſeal of it, <hi>the Lord knows them that are his,</hi> they are thoſe God has eternally deſigned for Happineſs and Glory, their Record is on high, their Names are in the Roll of God's eternal Determinations: And this ought to ſeem ſtrange to none, for no Man can with any tollerable ſenſe conceive that infinite Wiſdom ſhould make any thing and not at the ſame time deſign it to its utmoſt end; 'tis contradicted by our own finite and imperfect diſcretion, who ſtill have our eyes upon the ultimate end of all that we enterprize, and to me it ſeems that the whole ſyſtem of thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that are made againſt the Doctrine of God's Decrees touching Mens eternal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is fully diſcarded with this one conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that God infinitely foreſeeing and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowing from all eternity whatever any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he made would do, and how he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf when he ſhould be brought into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exiſtence, 'twas all one for him in point of Juſtice to determin his condition before he was made, as to determine it at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after all the actions of his Life were over, the preſcience of God cannot with any tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſatisfaction to our own reaſon be denyed, for whatever potentiality God created, he muſt needs know and foreſee the utmoſt extent of it, or elſe he could not deſign any certain end to himſelf by it, but might remain ignorant of the ſucceſs and event of a Creature which he had from himſelf given being to, which is abſurd to ſuppoſe, for infinite knowledge muſt needs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59586:93"/>and look beyond all finite actions, and therefore when God made Man with freedom of choice he muſt needs foreknow [that made that faculty] which way his will would incline, and the utmoſt journy it could poſſibly lead him, or elſe he muſt remain wholly ignorant what would be the ſuceeſs of his own Work, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of making any certain determination with himſelf about him. We find in Scripture preſcience and election always go together, and preſcience has the precedence, ſo in St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> firſt Epiſtle he calls thoſe to whom he wrote, <hi>elect according to the foreknowledge of God,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his deep and ſolemn diſcourſe about this matter tells us, <hi>whom he did foreknow them alſo he did predeſtinate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5thly, They are ſaid to come to God <hi>the Judge of all,</hi> they are come to the Lord paramount of the Church, the great author and end of all tranſactions therein; coming to him and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to him in Scripture Phraſe, is coming to partake of his Fovour and Grace, or elſe coming to the Judge of all, were of all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the moſt dreadful; the wicked he keeps at a diſtance, and is ſaid to know afar off; this is of all attainments the moſt Superlative, all that the Heart of Man can wiſh is included herein, to come to his Maker with acceptation, and to find favour in his ſight, whoſe favour is better then Life it ſelf; and to have the Supream Judge of all on his ſide: As this mighty Judge was accompanied with all poſſible terror and dread at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and all the People kept upon pain of Death at a great diſtance from him,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59586:94"/>to tell us how far removed from God every Man is by the Law, and in his ſinful eſtate, ſo by the Goſpel we are come as near to him as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature will admit, and he appears to us in all the glory of his reconciling Grace, and receives us into intimate fellowſhip and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him; for this is the declared ſtate of the Goſpel, <hi>We have fellowſhip with the Father and with the Son, and the blood of Jeſus cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Several things reſult from this Supreme Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Goſpel, That we are come to God, the Judge of all, as reconciled to him, and having his righteous judgment on our ſide:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That he will certainly revenge the Churches Cauſe upon all their implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who alone is the Judge of all Cauſes and Complaints, and whatever Controverſie hath been at any time in any Age between Satan and the Church, and between the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, prophane, perſecuting part of the World and the Church, God the Judge of all will determine it on the Churches ſide, will vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their innocency, and their faithful adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to him, his own intereſt and theirs being the ſame: And how great a comfort ought this to be to every ſincere Chriſtian, however per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and oppreſſed by Men, to conſider, that yet the righteous God is of his ſide, and that the Supreme Judge, who cannot do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſly, whoſe Judgment is the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Juſtice, and whoſe Judgment is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and irreverſible, will be ſure to give judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for him at laſt, and reward his Enemies with ſhame and confuſion.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:59586:94"/>
               <p n="2">2dly, He will certainly recompence all his Servants for every faithful ſervice they ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form for him; the reward of all their Works will be ſure to follow them into the next World; this is the great ſtay and ſupport to all true Chriſtians under their preſent preſſures, <hi>that their labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord:</hi> this St. <hi>Paul</hi> encouraged himſelf in the proſpect of, in the midſt of all the <hi>Heroclitons</hi> and Hurricanes of Perſecution he met with, <hi>There is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3dly, All the dreadful fears and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God that ever ſince the fall have inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the minds of Men, are by this acceſs unto God diſcharged and diſmiſs'd; this is that which hath kept the whole World in bondage all their days, the fear of God as their Judge ſtanding at the door, ready to execute Wrath upon all Diſobedience; this is the inward inviſible Wound Mankind carry about them; this is the inward heart-afflicting Fear and Terror of every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: nor can he any way diſcharge or disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den himſelf of it, for 'tis engraven in his being and is part of himſelf, every Man's own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which is the ability he has to judge of himſelf, with reference to the Judgment of God, is God's Vice-Roy, and whether he will or no, will give in evidence for God againſt him, and juſtifie truth againſt carnal and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt intereſt. What ſad and doleful reflections has the ſenſe of God's judgment occaſioned in Men? Men think of God and are troubled, and ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> Deſtruction from God was
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59586:95"/>a terrour to me, <hi>and by reaſon of his highneſs I could not endure.</hi> How uneaſie are Men in all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Comforts and Enjoyments where the ſenſe of this abides? A Man that has God for his Enemy at laſt, and nothing but this preſent World for his Portion, is meanly and wofully circumſtanced; now by the Goſpel, all this is removed, we come to the Judge of all as our beſt friend, and are able to ſay with an holy boaſt and ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ltation, Who ſhall condemn? 'tis God the Judge of all that juſtifies; who ſhall lay any thing to our charge? ſince the Supreme Judge of all the World is for us? what now can trouble us? what is it can now engender ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in our breaſts? we are now impregnable againſt ever being made truly miſerable, he that has God of his ſide can never be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy; the falſe corrupt judgment of this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed degenerate World, will be of mean value with us and little concern us, ſince the Judge of all is on our ſide, and we are ſecure of being by his judgment made eternally happy; for as the Apoſtle tells the ſuffering Saints, <hi>God will reward tribulation to them that trouble them, but to thoſe that are troubled, eternal rest and glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6thly, We are ſaid to be come <hi>to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect;</hi> that is, compleated in the full reward of their Chriſtian courſe; the Apoſtle mentions all the parts of the Goſpel, Catholick Church, both in Heaven and in Earth, to manifeſt to what a Noble and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Society we are joyned and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Faith of the Goſpel, and how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate and irrecoverable an evil Apoſtaſie from
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59586:95"/>ſuch a Communion were; this Expreſſion throws that fooliſh, idle Fiction of Purgatory quite out of dores, 'tis by this Expreſſion of the Apoſtle excommunicated and utterly caſt out of the Catholick Church for ever; for all the departed Saints are reckoned here to be in one only condition, they are not ſome in one ſtate and ſome in another, but they are all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat, which utterly confutes all the fictitious doting Dreams of ſuch a refining ſtate as Purgatory, every departed Saint's ſpirit is in a ſtate of perfection with God, they are all in his preſence, and therefore they are by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in this enumeration placed next unto him.</p>
               <p>The beſt way of conſidering this Expreſſion, is to diſcover what proſpect we can gain by it into the other World, and what can be certainly collected from it of the ſtate of the bleſſed in Heaven. Theſe three things are very plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive from hence: 1. That all the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted are in a ſtate of Perfection and enjoy a bleſſed Communion with God. 2. That they alſo enjoy a Communion with the Church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant here. And, 3. That the Church here enjoy alſo a Communion with them; both which laſt particulars are implied in our being ſaid to be come unto them. The Souls departed hence, have this Communion with the Church below; 1. They worſhip as they do him that ſits on the Throne and the Lamb, they adore the Merit of Chriſt's Blood, and the Glory of free Grace for ever; and whereſoever any Goſpel-worſhip is offered up upon Earth, they are preſent in ſpirit and concur in it, the Service and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59586:96"/>of Heaven is of the very ſame nature with that of the Saints upon Earth, thô performed in the Royal Preſence, and in the heavenly Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in ſome reſpects differently circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanc'd. 2. They have a tender regard to all the labouring, fighting, ſtriving Servants of Chriſt here below, wiſhing a happy ſucceſs to them, well remembring that themſelves were lately in that condition, the ſtate of the Church here that is at Sea and toſſed with many ſtorms, no doubt is much in their minds, thô they are ſafely arrived themſelves in the Harbour of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reſt and Happineſs. 3. They rejoyce greatly in all the Churches proſperity, and particularly in its increaſe; if the converſion of ſinners on Earth cauſe great joy in Heaven, no doubt but the Spirits made perfect are partakers of it as well as the Angels, for they are altogether as one Society, and they are equally capable of it as they are, for they are like the Angels of God, and they have much more cauſe to be concerned in the joy than the others, becauſe they themſelves have travelled through all the ſtages of Salvation, and all the Methods by which Souls come to glory, and are now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally informed what bleſſedneſs attends and waits upon every converted ſaved Soul. 4. They have communion with the Church here below, by being preſent with Chriſt, and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his bleſſed interceſſion for it, taking unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able delight and ſatisfaction therein, they behold all the concerns of the militant Church conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſented before the Father by the Son, and ſo are converſant with it, and have the ſame vital
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59586:96"/>love and concern for it that animates the whole.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, Our being ſaid to be come to them, implies ſome effect of that as an attainment, and ſome communion that is had with them on our part; 1. We have communion with them in this reſpect, when ever we addreſs our ſelves to God and perform any Worſhip to the Divine Majeſty, we do it with this certain aſſurance and knowledge, that he is incompaſſed with the holy Angels and all the Souls of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and bleſſed, and ſo in every act of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip we have a ſort of communion with them, he that converſeth with any great King, has a relative communion with his whole Court as appurtenant to him. 2. We are come unto them, and have a communion with them upon this account, becauſe we are in the ſame ſtate that brought them thither, we are in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the very ſame title to glory that brought them to it, we have in faith what they have in fruition, and we are continually waiting to be removed to them; we are therefore truly ſaid to be come to them becauſe we are of the ſame Houſhold and Family, and there is nothing wanting but our diſſolution to bring us actually into their Company, and into the ſame Place where they now are: And laſtly, we are come to them ſo, as to receive great incouragement from them in our Chriſtian Courſe, by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating what it has brought them unto; we are much animated to follow their example, and much advantaged every way by ſetting before us their glorious and bleſſed ſtate and condition.</p>
               <p n="7">7thly, We are here ſaid to be come to <hi>Jeſus the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59586:97"/>mediator of the new covenant.</hi> Here the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſets down the <hi>Alpha</hi> and the <hi>Omega</hi> of all this catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Society; this Jeſus is the Sourſe and Center of all, the great <hi>Corner-ſtone</hi> upon which all the Structure depends: In two things the force of the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> compariſon lies, 1. They are come to Jeſus himſelf a Saviour, and a Mediator far exceeding <hi>Moſes:</hi> And, 2. to a much better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, of which he is the Mediator. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Chriſt to <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Mediator, is large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcourſed of in this <hi>Epiſtle, Moſes</hi> was but a typical Mediator, employed as a middle perſon between God and the People, but Chriſt is the Son in his own Houſe. In this caſe God-man is the Mediator, and God is the perſon mediated unto; which conſideration perhaps may help to unfold that difficult expreſſion of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galat. A mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.</hi> In two things the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> makes the eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial difference between Chriſt and <hi>Moſes</hi> to lie, 1. Chriſt was the Surety of the Covenant unto God on the Peoples part; and ſo they are ſure not to fail in the performance of their part: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Moſes</hi> the People conſtantly failed in their part, and he was no way to undertake or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form for them. 2. Chriſt confirmed the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by his own Death, which <hi>Moſes</hi> did not; what he did was by the Blood of other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of Bulls and Goats; what Chriſt did, he did by his own Blood, and by the offering up of himſelf; and therefore coming to ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator as he is, <hi>Jeſus a Saviour as well as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> that has redeemed the Church with his own Blood; and ſuch a Mediator as he is, that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59586:97"/>lives for ever to make interceſſion, is infinitely better than to be baptized into <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Cloud and in the Sea.</p>
               <p>After all the Promiſes, Predictions, Types, and Prefigurations of him, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Jews,</hi> they are at laſt come to this Jeſus, to this Mediator and Saviour, their Fathers having travelled through ſo many Ages and Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before they arrived at his appearing, it would be the very laſt degree of all folly and contradiction to their own intereſt, to think of drawing back and returning to thoſe terrene Elements, by which he was figuratively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and which have now by his appearance totally ſpent themſelves in his ſignification, <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him</hi> as Mediator of this new Covenant, implies coming to all the Benefits and Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this Covenant, for all the Promiſes of God are in him, yea, and in him <hi>Amen;</hi> 'tis certain the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> by calling Chriſt the <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the new Covenant,</hi> intends to ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Goſpel-ſtate beyond that at <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> for the Law there given is ſaid to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator, which Mediator was <hi>Moſes,</hi> by conſent both of God and the People; upon which account they are ſaid to be baptized into him, and in regard God deſigned Chriſt as the glorious Mediator of a better Covenant, he well approved of what the People ſaid when they deſired, that God would not himſelf ſpeak any more to them, but deliver his Commands by <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe it was a Preparative intimation of the neceſſity of a better Covenant, attended with a more ſufficient
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59586:98"/>Mediator, who had no ſins of his own to account for, and ſo could approach unto God without that dread and fear that accompanied <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ſervice he performed. Two things will be neceſſary to be explained, fully to unfold the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's</hi> ſenſe, 1. What is meant by a Mediator; 2. What is meant by the New Covenant. By a Mediator here, is meant one that repreſents the People, and intercedes to God on their behalf, which was the circumſtance of <hi>Moſes;</hi> that theſe two qualifications might be eminently appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Chriſt, to compleat him for that ſervice in a way infinitely exceeding <hi>Moſes,</hi> he is God and Man in one perſon; as Man, a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect repreſentative of all Mankind; and as God, ſuch an Interceſſor as procures Salvation to the uttermoſt for all that come to God by him, and not only in <hi>Moſes</hi> way, by a bare repreſentation of the Peoples condition before God, but by his own inherent Merit procuring all the grace, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and acceptation on their behalf they could either hope for or deſire.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, By the New Covenant we are ſure Mount <hi>Sion</hi> is oppoſed to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and the Goſpel ſet in oppoſition to the Law; we find in the New Teſtament mention but of two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, <hi>the law given</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which (is ſaid to grow old, and to be ready to vaniſh away) and is called the firſt Covenant, and the Goſpel preached of old to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed at large by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which is called the New Covenant: This New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is alſo called a Teſtament, becauſe the great Promulgation of it was to be a conſequent
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59586:98"/>of Chriſt's death; and the Goſpel that Law and Covenant of Grace, the Legacy he left to the World, was to be diſpenſed to the Legatees by his grand Executor the Holy Ghoſt: And whatever we read of God's Covenants in the Old Teſtament, 'tis to be reduced to one of theſe two; for the Apoſtle in the 8th and 9th Chapters of this Epiſtle, calls the Moſaical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the firſt Covenant, and the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the whole Moſaical oeconomy was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in it, and reckoned as part of it, but it was chiefly denominated from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was the moſt ſolemn promulgation of the moſt eſſential part of it. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God made with Man in his Innocency, was peculiar to him in that ſtate, and went no farther, is not at all continued in any force ſince the fall. By a Covenant of God in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſence of it, is meant a Law promulged, wherein God obliges himſelf to ſuch rewards and puniſhments; and Men ſtand obliged to ſuch duty and performance; this was the caſe of the Old Covenant at <hi>Sinai,</hi> and ſo is the caſe under the Goſpel; God has in Chriſt oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to the ſalvation of the World upon ſuch and ſuch terms, and Man ſtands obliged to the performance of them if ever he will be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: 'Tis a vain and a wild conceit to think the Goſpel offers Salvation otherways, then upon conditions to be performed on our part; the firſt Proclamation of it is with this condition annexed, he that believes ſhall be ſaved: And Faith is every-where uſed in the Goſpel, as a Word comprehenſive of all that is therein requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59586:99"/>of us. Punctually to purſue the Apoſtles drift in this place by this expreſſion, the beſt way is to ſhew in what particulars this <hi>new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> to which he tells the Believing <hi>Hebrews</hi> they were come, exceeded the old, which was the point he deſigned to himſelf to make good.</p>
               <p n="1">1st, Both Covenants agreed in this, they both had a Mediator, an internuncius between God and Man, which was to inform us of the vaſt diſtance ſin had made between them, what a vaſt gulph there was fixed between Heaven and Earth, and that 'twas impoſſible there ſhould be any converſe between God and Man, by vertue of any Covenant without ſome third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon interpoſing, and herein this New Covenant has infinitely the preference; the Mediator of it being of ſo glorious a compoſition and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and ſo adapted to this matter as is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to conceive; he that intercedes to bring God and Man together, is himſelf both (after a ſtupenduous and wonderful manner) united in one and the ſame Perſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, This New Covenant delivers us from all the Fear, Bondage, and Condemnation, which the Old Covenant brought upon us, the Law left Men to anſwer to God for their diſobedience, without either aſſiſtance or remedy, and ſo the caſe of every Man was, that when the <hi>law came ſin revived, and he dyed;</hi> by coming to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of this New Covenant, we are totally diſcharged from any concern with the Law or the firſt Covenant, the ſatisfaction of Chriſt to God's Juſtice is fully accepted in our ſtead, for all our diſobedience of the Law of Works, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59586:99"/>by this New Covenant we are wholly diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from any obligation to the Old, God found fault with it, and it being in its nature and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prepare for a better Covenant, it grew Old, and upon the publication of the Goſpel is quite vaniſhed away.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, This New Covenant much exceeds the other in its nature and conſtitution, for it always admits of Repentance and Pardon, which the other never did, 'tis an intire Law of Grace, accepts of ſincerity of intention, in the ſtead of perfection of action, and is accommodated with all imaginable tenderneſs to the weak and frail conſtitution of Man ſince his fall.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, And wherein the Glory of this New Covenant chiefly lies, and wherein it funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally exceeds the other, and diſplays emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently the Glory of God's Grace and Goodneſs to the World; a Divine ability is given from Heaven for the performance of every part of it, whatever is required is given: the great ſecurity of Mens Salvation under this New Covenant is, <hi>that we are kept by the mighty power of God through faith unto ſalvation,</hi> and that when Men <hi>work out their ſalvation,</hi> 'tis <hi>God that worketh in them both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure;</hi> 'tis his power that is perfected in weakneſs, and grace only that proves ſufficient for us in this caſe, the ways and methods by which this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt from above, is conveyed into the Hearts and ſpirits of Men is admirable, but known only to God, and out of the compaſs of all humane diſcovery, a Man born after the Spirit is compared to the Wind,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59586:100"/>the effects of which we know, but we know nothing whence it comes nor whither it goes, how far God is pleaſed at firſt in ſome to move and excite humane abilities, and ſtill to reward their motion Heaven-ward with more and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace, and how far he is pleaſed in others to reward with Divine aſſiſtance, endeavours purely Natural and Human, is a knowledge too high for us, and what we cannot by ſearching attain to, this we are ſure of, that grace is never wanting to ſuch as make a faithful improvement of what power they have, he that under the Goſpel does but what he can do, will be ſure to be enabled to do what he ſhould do, I make no queſtion but that generally ſpeaking grace comes in to the aſſiſtance of Humane endeavours, and is grafted at firſt upon ſuch natural improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are preparative to the reception of Chriſt and the Goſpel, but 'tis not always ſo, but Grace breaks in upon ſome in the height of their carreer againſt Chriſt and the Goſpel, as it did upon St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to make him an inſtance in this point, and makes a perfect conqueſt of the Soul unto Chriſt, where there is nothing but a Wicked Profane oppoſition againſt him.</p>
               <p>Had not this Divine aſſiſtance been a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appurtenant to the Covenant of Grace, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had never reaped the benefit of it, no terms of Salvation that were conſiſting with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Juſtice of God, though never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending and eaſie without this, would ever have made Mankind happy; ſo deſparate [and as to their own power] irrecoverable an apoſtacy are all Men ſubjected to, ſo that if either we
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59586:100"/>conſider the Mediator of this <hi>New Covenant,</hi> or the <hi>Covenant</hi> it ſelf, we ſhall perceive the great advantage the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> has of his ſide in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, and what a fooliſh choice the believing <hi>Jews</hi> would make to depart and apoſtatize from this <hi>New Covenant</hi> and this <hi>Mediator,</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> and Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt thing the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> mentions, and which he couples and conjoyns with the Mediator of this <hi>New Covenant,</hi> as inſeparably appurtenant to both, is the <hi>Blood of Sprinkling,</hi> which he ſays, <hi>ſpeaks better things than the Blood of Abel;</hi> this is particularly and emphatically mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the death and ſuffering of Chriſt, the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his precious Blood, was the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his mediatory Work here upon Earth, the grand Fundamental of the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and of all the effects and conſequences of it, all was purchaſed by this as the price of it, and in regard the <hi>Jews</hi> had been much accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed under the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> to the ſhedding of Blood, without which there was no remiſſion; the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> inſtructs them, that this <hi>New Covenant</hi> infinitely excels the other in that very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and he calls it <hi>the Blood of Sprinkling,</hi> becauſe there was no Blood at any time offered under the Law but part of it was ſprinkled, and as the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> at <hi>Horeb</hi> was confirmed by <hi>Moſes</hi> the Mediator of it, by ſprinkling the Blood of the Oxen then ſacrificed, ſo this <hi>New Covenant</hi> is ratified by the ſprinkling of Blood, but 'tis ſuch Blood as of which all that was ſhed before was but typical, and ſuch Blood as is of an infinite value, the Blood of God himſelf, and as the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59586:101"/>
                  <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the 9th <hi>Chap.</hi> makes the compariſon, if <hi>the blood of bulls and goates</hi> ſays he, could ſerve for Legal, Typical, and Ceremonial Purifications, how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt who by the Eternal Spirit offer'd up himſelf without ſpot to God; purge your Conſciences from dead Works, ſo that by this expreſſion the Apoſtle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this blood the <hi>blood of ſprinkling,</hi> we are to underſtand that this is the <hi>ſoul purifying, ſoul-juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and ſoul-ſaving blood,</hi> of which all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd Blood ſince the World began, ſince <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>'s firſt Sacrifices were but a Type, and Prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, 'tis being ſprinkled with this, that gives entrance and admittance into Heaven, the true ſanctuary, of which admittance into the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſanctuary by the ſprinkling of blood was but a Type, and this blood as 'tis of tranſcendent Power and Vertue, ſo it has a general and univerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al efficacy, ſo the Prophet <hi>Eſau</hi> tells us, <hi>Eſau</hi> 52.15. Where 'tis Propheſied, that Chriſt ſhould with his Blood ſprinkle many Nations; which refers to that univerſal advantage the gentile World ſhould reap by it, this blood is not like the blood of the legal ſacrifices, that was often ſhed, and reached but to one Nation, this blood is of that infinite value, that the whole race of Mankind, the whole World are ſprinkled with it in order to Juſtification and Salvation, and there needs no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of it, for by this one Sacrifice offer'd up, Chriſt has for ever perfected them that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and there remains no more Sacrifice for Sin; this blood the Apoſtle ſays ſpeaks better things then the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> which was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of great moment unto the <hi>Jews.</hi> Some
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59586:101"/>modern interpreters [for I ſee it in no ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor] conceive by the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> here, is not meant his own blood, but the blood of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices he ſlew, which were the firſt we read of that God accepted, and he gave ſuch a Teſtimonial to them, that in the foregoing Chapter the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſays upon that account <hi>he is yet ſpoken of,</hi> not as 'tis vulgarly rendred <hi>yet ſpeaketh, but is yet ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of:</hi> That which induc'd them to make this meaning of the Apoſtles Words, was I ſuppoſe the little advantage there ſeems to be in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon; to compare the blood of a Saviour with the blood of a murdered Man, then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could ſpeak worſe, for it muſt needs call for vengeance and puniſhment, and therefore there ſeems at firſt view to be little commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given to the blood of Chriſt by ſaying that it ſpeaks better things then the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> for it could not ſpeak worſe, but to ſay it ſpeaks better things then the very firſt ſacrifice we read of that God accepted and gave teſtimony to, &amp; of the beſt Man then in the World, carries great advantage in the compariſon; this interpretation upon this account ſeems probable and is plauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but 'tis not as I conceive the ſenſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and to me it ſeems rejected. By the words upon this account, that the voice and cry that <hi>Abel</hi>'s blood is ſaid to have, was after his death, and God tells <hi>Cain</hi> his Brothers blood cryed unto him, and ſo it was <hi>Abel</hi>'s own blood that cryed; now 'tis plain, the Apoſtle in ſaying that Chriſt's blood ſpeaks better things then the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> ſpeaks, alludes to the ſpeaking and crying of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>'s blood from the ground unto God, as 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> had not only many
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59586:102"/>falſe and pernicious inſtructors ready to diſwade them from receiving the Goſpel at firſt, but after any of them had received it, there were many falſe Judaizing Apoſtles who endeavour'd all they could to engage them to a relapſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie either in whole or in part, the Apoſtles buſineſs as has been often ſuggeſted is to prevent this latter, and to eſtabliſh ſuch as had received the Chriſtian Doctrine, but were in danger of drawing back. Now 'tis moſt certain, that amongſt other diſcouragements that were ſuggeſted to the <hi>Believing Hebrews,</hi> this was one of the chief, and with which they were much affected, that they and their rulers having ſhed the blood of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and taken it upon themſelves and their poſterity; and ſome of the Apoſtles having open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their faces reproached the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation with it, that they had been the betrayers and murderers of this Holy and Bleſſed Jeſus the Son of God, they could not reaſonably hope for nor expect any benefit from that blood they had ſo murderouſly ſhed. To obviate this objection, the Apoſtle after he had mentioned the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of this <hi>New Covenant</hi> and his blood where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſprinkles the World, to which he tells them by the Goſpel they were come, adds this, [which is of peculiar force and reference to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and very emphatically <hi>argumentum ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>] that this blood ſpeaks better things then the blood of <hi>Abel, Abel</hi> was murdered and his blood ſpake and cryed from the Ground to Heaven for yengeance upon his brother that murdered him, but Chriſt was Betrayed and Murdered, and his blood calls and cries aloud for pardon and forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his very betrayers and crucifiers, ſo that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59586:102"/>none of them need to fall into <hi>Cain</hi>'s deſparation, and quit the Goſpel upon any ſuch ſad conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for this Blood, though it was ſhed like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>'s, yet had quite another Cry and Language attended it, it called for no vengeance upon any man, but for Peace, Pardon, and Reconciliation for all men, even the very worſt of his Enemies and Crucifiers; and this renders the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of wonderful advantage and efficacy to that end for which it was intended. Nothing is more uſual in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Writings [eſpecially in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi>] than to anſwer Objections, that were then well and commonly known, without reciting them, of which we at this day are often ignorant, and ſo his Writings ſeems to us the more difficult and obſcure.</p>
               <p>Thus we have taken a brief view of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Compariſon of the Law with the Goſpel in this ſhort Epitome of both, and ſeen the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preference the Goſpel has to the Law, and the great and eminent Advantages and Priviledges of the one above the the other, and the glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this Spiritual Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not only all the true Saints upon Earth, the Church of the firſt-born writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Heaven, but even God himſelf, Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, all the Bleſſed Angels, and the Spirits of juſt Men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; nothing could be more deſtructive and ruinous to the true Intereſt of the believing <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> than to turn their backs upon ſuch a Communion, to go back to the Old Covenant that God upon Man's account found fault with, and again put on that Legal Yoke that neither they nor their Fathers were able to bear; the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59586:103"/>
                  <hi>Jews</hi> much boaſted of, and reſted in thoſe lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Typical Advantages they had above the reſt of the World, upon which they might with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good reaſon value themſelves; and therefore the Apoſtle's buſineſs is to manifeſt to them, how much by embracing the Goſpel they changed for the better; that inſtead of a Legal Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Temple built upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and an Earthly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they are come to the true ſignified Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> to the Spiritual and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Temple, which is <hi>Chriſt Myſtical,</hi> where God dwells for ever, and the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the name of which is <hi>Jehovah Shammai,</hi> that is, the glorious ſpiritual worſhip of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and the ſtate of the Catholick Church in all its parts, thoſe on Earth, and thoſe in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and thereby to all that was ſignified by, and all that was any where promiſed unto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> inſtead of that Dreadful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Angels upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> with which they were ſo terrified, and from which they were kept at ſo great a diſtance, they are now come to an innumerable Company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that is, to a ſweet Fellowſhip, Brotherhood, and Communion with them; all which is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their being ſaid to be come to them: under the Law 'twas firmly believed whoever ſhould ſee an Angel [ſo great the diſtance was thought between Mankind and them] ſhould certainly die; we are now Men and Angels all of the ſame Family and Houſhold, and the Saints on Earth have the whole Miniſtry and Service of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels employed on their behalf, they are now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways aſcending and deſcending about their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and there is a moſt endeared and intimate
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59586:103"/>Relation and Affection between all the Myriads of Angels above and the Saints below; inſtead of the National Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> aſſembled at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they are come to the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and Church of the firſt-born, whoſe Names are written in Heaven. To the general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the true Catholick Church, who Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Worſhip all the World over in Spirit and Truth, without any confinement to any place whatever, they are come to them, ſo as to be of the ſame Body and Society with them, to be fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Citizens with the Saints and of the Houſhold of God, and ſo as to partake of all their Spiritual and Heavenly Advantages, and they are come to all the parts of this Catholick Communion, as well thoſe in Heaven as thoſe on Earth, even to God himſelf [which is as far as they can come] <hi>the judge of all:</hi> under the Law they were not ſuffered ſo much as to approach the outward ſigns of his Preſence, but under the Goſpel they have free acceſs to himſelf, and to his very Throne, which is now become a Throne of Grace, and nothing appears now from thence but a Scepter of Mercy held forth, they are come to the Spirits of juſt men made perfect, not only to the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Fraternity of all the Saints living, from the Fraternity of an outward, Typical, and only National Church, but to thoſe in the Heavenly ſtate, all thoſe mentioned in the 11th. <hi>Chap.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and all the Apoſtles, and thoſe Bleſſed Saints they had converſed with in the firſt times of the Goſpel, who were then removed and gone to their reſt, even to them by the Goſpel-ſtate they were come, with them they are embodyed as Members of the ſame Society, and with them
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59586:104"/>in a ſhort time they are ſure to be reſident, And to <hi>Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant,</hi> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour as well as a Mediator, and a Mediator not of the <hi>Sinai,</hi> but of the <hi>Sion</hi> Covenant, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant bringing grace, life, and peace; a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor not like <hi>Moſes,</hi> a meer Man, a Servant, a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, himſelf trembling in his Office, and weary of his Burden, and whoſe Miniſtry was like his Perſon, decaying, vaniſhing, and dying. But to the Son himſelf in his own Houſe, able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to God by him, in that he liveth for <hi>ever</hi> to make Interceſſion for them, and to the Blood of ſprinkling, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely exceeding all the Blood that was ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led under the Law, for that brought ſin yearly and daily into remembrance, but thoſe that are ſprinkled with this are for ever perfected, and to them there remains no more Sacrifice for ſin, and this Blood they are come to ſpeaks a better Language quite than the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> did, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Blood of both was moſt unjuſtly ſhed, and they were both wickedly murdered and ſlain, yet they ſpeak two different Languages, <hi>Abel</hi>'s Blood called and cried unto God for vengeance upon <hi>Cain,</hi> but this pleads and cries aloud for pardon and forgiveneſs, even for thoſe very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were moſt guilty of it, and deeplieſt concerned in it, ſo that none are excluded from the benefit of it.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle winds up all with deep and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Admonitions and Cautions to the Believing <hi>Jews,</hi> not to play faſt and loſe with the Goſpel; 'tis of ſuch <hi>Jews</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> writes in his Epiſtle directed to the Twelve Tribes, when he tells them, <hi>A double-minded man is unſtable in all his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59586:104"/>ways; and let not ſuch a man think</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to obtain any thing from the Lord,</hi> for he halts between two Opinions, and is unreſolved whether he ſhall be a Jew or a Chriſtian, the Apoſtle conjures them upon their utmoſt peril not to refuſe him that <hi>ſpeaks from Heaven,</hi> which is no other than God himſelf ſpeaking by his Son, and declaring by a ſolemn voice from Heaven, even from the excellent Glory, that he was his Beloved Son in whom he was well pleaſed, which beloved and bleſſed Son of God might well be ſaid to ſpeak from Heaven, becauſe we are expreſly told he was alſo in Heaven when he ſpake here upon Earth; he proceeds to mind them that the Legal ſtate was like an old Houſe ready to fall upon their heads, for he that once by his voice ſhook the Earth at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and made the Mount to tremble, will now once more ſhake both Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and diſſolve, the Apoſtle tells them, their whole Religious Conſtitution and Fabrick; and this taking away of things that are ſhaken, is in order to this, that things that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſhaken which are the bleſſings, and glories, and ſure mercies of the Goſpel, may remain, the Goſpel is the laſt and only remedy that God has provided for ſinful Man, 'tis a fearful thing to fall into his hands, and not have this to plead, to fall into the hands of the living God, without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Jeſus the Mediator of this New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the Blood of ſprinkling appurtenant thereunto: he that has once embraced the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and then out of choice refuſeth it, and turns his back upon it, refuſeth his remedy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by renders his Cure deſperate and impoſſible, and to ſuch a man nothing can poſſibly remain
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59586:105"/>but <hi>a certain fearful looking for of Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conſideration of this Glorious and Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable ſtate to which by the Goſpel we are come, this Celeſtial <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>Spirits,</hi> ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inflame our minds with holy and thankful Contemplations, and alſo with fervent and devout adoration of that infinite goodneſs that has made ſuch proviſion for the happineſs, recovery and welfare of rebellious and apoſtate Man, that has opened the flood-gates of Heaven, and ſhowr'd down all the bleſſings and glories thereof upon the World, by the deſcent of the ſecond perſon into Human Nature; how happy were it if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of mean, low, and periſhing ſatisfactions, Men would ſolace themſelves with this <hi>heart-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying</hi> and everlaſting Salvation, let us follow the example of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who when God proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Name unto him, and cauſed all his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to paſs before him, the Text ſays, <hi>Moſes made haſte, and bowed his head towards the earth and worſhipped,</hi> he only heard the report of what we poſſeſs and enjoy, our whole buſineſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be to exalt the Praiſes of ſo Gracious a Benefactor, and to Magnifie that Glorious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that has all poſſible Perfection, to whom nothing can be added, and from whom nothing can be taken away, and to whom all Bleſſing and Honour, and Praiſe, and all Worſhip, and Service, and Adoration will be due throughout all Generations, from time to time, till time ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and is diſſolved in Eternity, and thence <hi>Etern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi>
